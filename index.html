        <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 001] As the sun sets, a soft sheet of golden sunlight settles across a peaceful island. An ocean softly curls around this island, around and around, slowly circling across the entire planet. Resting on one shore of this island is one solitary building, the only building on this planet. It is an observatory, and for years this has been the home of just one person. However, at the moment, there are two people on this planet. Allias drags Alka through the observatory door, both of them dripping wet. A burnt and torn uniform clings to Alka’s limp body. The door clicks shut behind them. The sunset peeks through the observatory windows and casts shadows of Allias and Alka across the equipment in the observatory, sending flickers of golden gray across the metal, and the light rays fill the droplets flung from their soaked clothing. The shadows all fall when Allias slips, and Allias and Alka slam into the floor. The thud echoes within the observatory. Allias, shivering, pushes up against the floor and looks back in dread at Alka’s silent body. There’s nobody else to ask for help. Allias rises and continues to drag Alka, ignoring the feeling of faint, ignoring the red streak on the floor behind Alka, ignoring how neither of them know each other, and ignoring the pot of soup that has been gently boiling in the observatory’s kitchen since today’s sunrise.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 002] Allias drags Alka into the heart of the observatory, where a monstrous bulk of metal rises to the domed ceiling. The sun has now completely set, and many sets of holiday lights carefully draped across the equipment have flickered on, synchronized to a small timer Allias had set several years ago. The little lights make all the metal panels shine in several subtle colors. It isn’t long before Allias is sitting at the edge of this bulk of metal, scanning a dimmed computer screen. Allias can’t tell if Alka will survive. Alka is now out of sight, resting on an extremely comfortable bed, several meters away from Allias. This bed, the centerpiece of the observatory, lies directly beneath the bulk of metal, and an elegant monstrosity of cables and metal arms envelopes the bed in a jungle of technology so complex anyone could stare at it forever and still notice something new. This used to bother Allias, but after several years of work, Allias had found that this metal monster was already in its simplest, most minimal state, and Allias had to insist, for Allias’ own sanity, that no, this is not the work of an evil scientist, alien species, or top dollar sci-fi film studio, and yes, every piece has a meaningful, refined purpose. But this isn’t a typical observatory.

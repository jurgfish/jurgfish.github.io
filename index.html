        <p class="anim"> [Island of Mind 001] As the sun sets, a soft sheet of golden sunlight settles across a peaceful island. An ocean gently curls around this island, around and around, spanning the rest of the planet. On this lone island rests a lone observatory, and in this lone observatory is the home and cherished project of a lone individual. This is no longer true. At the moment, there are two people on this planet: Allias drags Aka through the observatory door, both of them dripping wet. A burnt and torn uniform clings to Aka’s limp body. The door clicks shut behind them. The sunset peeks through the observatory windows and casts shadows of Allias and Aka across the equipment in the observatory, sending flickers of golden gray across the metal, and the light rays fill the droplets flung from their soaked clothing. The shadows all fall when Allias slips and falls. Allias and Aka slam into the floor, and the thud echoes within the observatory. Allias, shivering, pushes up against the floor and looks back in dread at Aka’s silent body. There’s nobody else to ask for help. Allias rises and continues to drag Aka, ignoring the feeling of faint, ignoring the red streak on the floor behind Aka, ignoring how neither of them know each other, and ignoring the pot of soup that has been gently boiling in the kitchen since today’s sunrise.</p> 

        <p class="anim"> [Island of Mind 002] Allias drags Aka into the heart of the observatory, where a monstrous bulk of metal rises to the domed ceiling. The sun has now completely set, and many sets of holiday lights carefully draped across this equipment have flickered on, synchronized to a small timer Allias had set several years ago. It isn’t long before Allias is staring at a dimmed computer screen. Allias can’t tell if Aka is alive. Aka is now out of sight, resting on an extremely comfortable bed, several meters away from Allias. This bed, the centerpiece of observatory, lies directly beneath the bulk of metal, and an elegant monstrosity of cables and metal arms envelopes the bed in a jungle of technology so complex anyone could stare at it forever and still notice something new. This used to bother Allias, but after several years of work, Allias had found that this metal monster was already in its simplest, most minimal state, and Allias had to insist, for Allias’ own sanity, that no, this is not the work of an evil scientist, alien species, or top dollar sci-fi film studio, and yes, every piece has a meaningful, refined purpose. But this isn’t a typical observatory. </p> 

        <p class="anim"> [Island of Mind 003] This elegant monster wasn’t designed to bring people back to life. While one of its certain purposes is to keep people alive, its true purpose is far more intimate. At the moment, all Allias can do is wait. Allias watches a little logo bounce against the edges of the computer screen. Allias had already noticed the unfamiliar logo printed on the breast of Aka’s shirt: in happy, bold letters, the initials of the Space Mail Service. Allias was not expecting a delivery. Whatever the delivery was, it is now tucked in a compartment in what remains of a derpy little spaceship, now lost to the depths of this planet’s ocean. </p>

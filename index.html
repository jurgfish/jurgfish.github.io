            [Island of Mind 001] As the sun sets, a soft sheet of golden sunlight settles across a peaceful island. An ocean softly curls around this island, around and around, slowly circling across the entire planet. Resting on one shore of this island is one solitary building, the only building on this planet. It is an observatory, and for years this has been the home of just one person. However, at the moment, there are two people on this planet. Allias drags Aka through the observatory door, both of them dripping wet. A burnt and torn uniform clings to Aka’s limp body. The door clicks shut behind them. The sunset peeks through the observatory windows and casts shadows of Allias and Aka across the equipment in the observatory, sending flickers of golden gray across the metal, and the light rays fill the droplets flung from their soaked clothing. The shadows all fall when Allias slips, and Allias and Aka slam into the floor. The thud echoes within the observatory. Allias, shivering, pushes up against the floor and looks back in dread at Aka’s silent body. There’s nobody else to ask for help. Allias rises and continues to drag Aka, ignoring the feeling of faint, ignoring the red streak on the floor behind Aka, ignoring how neither of them know each other, and ignoring the pot of soup that has been gently boiling in the kitchen since today’s sunrise.
        </p> <p class="anim">
            [Island of Mind 002] Allias drags Aka into the heart of the observatory, where a monstrous bulk of metal rises to the domed ceiling. The sun has now completely set, and many sets of holiday lights carefully draped across the equipment have flickered on, synchronized to a small timer Allias had set several years ago. The little lights make all the metal panels shine subtly in different colors. It isn’t long before Allias is sitting at the edge of this bulk of metal, staring at a dimmed computer screen. Allias can’t tell if Aka is alive. Aka is now out of sight, resting on an extremely comfortable bed, several meters away from Allias. This bed, the centerpiece of observatory, lies directly beneath the bulk of metal, and an elegant monstrosity of cables and metal arms envelopes the bed in a jungle of technology so complex anyone could stare at it forever and still notice something new. This used to bother Allias, but after several years of work, Allias had found that this metal monster was already in its simplest, most minimal state, and Allias had to insist, for Allias’ own sanity, that no, this is not the work of an evil scientist, alien species, or top dollar sci-fi film studio, and yes, every piece has a meaningful, refined purpose. But this isn’t a typical observatory.
        </p> <p class="anim">
            [Island of Mind 003] This elegant metal monster wasn’t designed to bring people back to life. While one of its certain purposes is to keep people alive, its true purpose is far more intimate. At the moment, all Allias can do is wait. Allias watches a little logo bounce against the edges of the monster’s computer screen. Allias had already noticed Aka’s logo. It was printed on the breast of Aka’s uniform: now scorched, but in happy, bold letters, the initials of the Space Mail Service. Allias was not expecting a delivery. Whatever the delivery was, it is now tucked within what remains of a derpy little spaceship, now lost to the depths of this planet’s ocean.
        </p> <p class="anim">
            [Island of Mind 004] Earlier, when the spaceship crashed, the wreck stayed afloat long enough for Allias to swim out and rescue Aka. Aka had been severely injured upon impact. Aka had also passed out, and Allias was surprised to find Aka mostly intact. Had Allias not been there, Aka would have drifted down to the bottom of the ocean. It was eerily calm right after Allias began to swim back to shore. Allias was barely managing to tow the limp Aka, but this rescue quickly became ridiculously difficult when Aka suddenly woke, took one look at Allias, and panicked: “…what? what is THIS?” Aka flailed and they both began to sink: “I need to…” Aka sharply inhaled in pain: “this isn’t…” Aka gasped for air as Allias yelled at Aka to relax. Aka shoved Allias: “NO!!” Aka then faded and sank, and Allias dove after Aka.
        </p> <p class="anim">
            [Island of Mind 005] When Allias and Aka resurfaced, Aka continued to flail as Allias tried to push Aka towards shore. Aka shoved Allias again: “let me GO!” Aka started to fade again, and Allias struggled to keep Aka’s head above the water as Aka grew heavy in pain: “it’s cold…” This pain was crisp in Aka’s voice: “it’s so cold…” Aka seemed to be speaking to the clouds above: “where’s my-” Aka flailed again, smacking Allias in the face as Aka screamed: “my SHIP?!” Allias only briefly considered abandoning Aka out in the ocean. It had taken Allias a very long time to rescue Aka. This was the first time Allias had spent that long in the water. The ocean is always cold and completely empty. Aka had passed out again right before they got to shore. And now, still shivering, Allias waits by the metal monster, strangely wanting more than anything to hear Aka say anything again. Allias thinks about how it’s strange to feel more lonely with a silent someone than with no one.
        </p> <p class="anim">
            [Island of Mind 006] Allias leans away from the screen and stands up, lost in a new thought. Looking for a distraction, Allias heads towards the observatory kitchen. The soup from this morning is still gently boiling, and Allias ladles some of it into a bowl, noticing the little bubbles, face just above the steam. The steam is warm, and it leaves a faint mark on a nearby window. Allias looks at the night sky outside the observatory, taking some time to think. All that had happened earlier stands pale when compared to the rest of Allias’ life. But Allias had never been through something like this. This occasion is certainly unique and momentous for Allias. Staring at the night sky, Allias ponders delicately over a difficult decision. After a while, Allias is sitting again next to the metal monster, fighting off the growing weight of sleep.
        </p> <p class="anim">
            [Island of Mind 007] It’s difficult to convey beauty in the passage of time when there is little to expect. It’s easy to fill a dull moment with aimless fidgeting or wandering thoughts. It’s hard to say nothing happened and just leave it at that, a blank page. Allias refuses to admit that life is often a blank page. There is a genuine truth in nothingness that people want to challenge. Nearly all people take this challenge, and the result of all this together creates something catastrophically beautiful.
        </p> <p class="anim">
            [Island of Mind 008] This silent waiting is taking a toll on Allias. It’s already tomorrow.
        </p> <p class="anim">
            [Island of Mind 009] This is the best place to start. This moment, when Allias decides to fully engage the monster, typing on the keyboard, staring at the dimmed screen, Aka resting on the extremely comfortable bed beneath a dizzying bulk of observatory equipment, and this bulk, this monster, suddenly roaring to life at Allias’ command, but not in a machine-like way, rather more like an orchestral hum, the largest orchestra to ever exist, with every instrument tuning, but to different notes, and some of the instruments are people, a sizable choir, and one of the instruments seems to be playing its own melody, and then the holiday lights scattered throughout the observatory start to dim and flicker as the monster draws in more energy, and soon the noise collects itself and collapses into something pleasant, like the theme of a stream at the toes of several mountains, spinning around the roots of aged trees, and it starts to get dark, very dark, but pleasantly dark, like the dark of the excitement before a premiere of a film you’ve been forever wanting to see, or what the night sky feels like when you’re watching it with someone you love. As the theme continues, Allias leaves the screen and walks towards the bed where Aka rests. Allias lays on the bed next to Aka, both of them now beneath the monster, and Allias’ eyes close. This is the story of Allias’ decision.

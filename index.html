        <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 001] As the sun sets, a soft sheet of golden sunlight settles across a peaceful island. An ocean softly curls around this island, around and around, slowly circling across the entire planet. Resting on one shore of this island is one solitary building, the only building on this planet. It is an observatory, and for years this has been the home of just one person. However, at the moment, there are two people on this planet. Allias drags Alka through the observatory door, both of them dripping wet. A burnt and torn uniform clings to Alka’s limp body. The door clicks shut behind them. The sunset peeks through the observatory windows and casts shadows of Allias and Alka across the equipment in the observatory, sending flickers of golden gray across the metal, and the light rays fill the droplets flung from their soaked clothing. The shadows all fall when Allias slips, and Allias and Alka slam into the floor. The thud echoes within the observatory. Allias, shivering, pushes up against the floor and looks back in dread at Alka’s silent body. There’s nobody else to ask for help. Allias rises and continues to drag Alka, ignoring the feeling of faint, ignoring the red streak on the floor behind Alka, ignoring how neither of them know each other, and ignoring the pot of soup that has been gently boiling in the observatory’s kitchen since today’s sunrise.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 002] Allias drags Alka into the heart of the observatory, where a monstrous bulk of metal rises to the domed ceiling. The sun has now completely set, and many sets of holiday lights carefully draped across the equipment have flickered on, synchronized to a small timer Allias had set several years ago. The little lights make all the metal panels shine in several subtle colors. It isn’t long before Allias is sitting at the edge of this bulk of metal, scanning a dimmed computer screen. Allias can’t tell if Alka will survive. Alka is now out of sight, resting on an extremely comfortable bed, several meters away from Allias. This bed, the centerpiece of the observatory, lies directly beneath the bulk of metal, and an elegant monstrosity of cables and metal arms envelopes the bed in a jungle of technology so complex anyone could stare at it forever and still notice something new. This used to bother Allias, but after several years of work, Allias had found that this metal monster was already in its simplest, most minimal state, and Allias had to insist, for Allias’ own sanity, that no, this is not the work of an evil scientist, alien species, or top dollar sci-fi film studio, and yes, every piece has a meaningful, refined purpose. But this isn’t a typical observatory.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 003] This elegant metal monster wasn’t designed to bring people back to life. While one of its certain purposes is to keep people alive, its true purpose is far more intimate. At the moment, all Allias can do is wait. The monster makes a soothing, whirling noise in the background as it computes. Allias absently watches a little logo animate on the monster’s computer screen. Allias had already noticed the logo printed on the breast of Alka’s uniform: now scorched, but in happy, bold letters, the initials of the Space Mail Service. Allias was not expecting a delivery. Whatever the delivery was, it is now tucked within what remains of a derpy little spaceship, now lost to the depths of this planet’s ocean.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 004] Earlier, when the spaceship crashed, the wreck stayed afloat long enough for Allias to swim out and rescue Alka. Alka had been severely injured upon impact. Alka had also passed out, and Allias was surprised to find Alka mostly intact. Had Allias not been there, Alka would have drifted down to the bottom of the ocean. It was eerily calm right after Allias began to swim back to shore. Allias was barely managing to tow the limp Alka, but this rescue quickly became ridiculously difficult when Alka suddenly woke, took one look at Allias, and panicked: “…what is THIS?!” They both began to sink as Alka flailed: “this isn’t…” Alka sharply inhaled in pain and then gasped for air as Allias tried to get Alka to calm down. Alka shoved Allias: “NO!!” Alka then faded  out and sank, and Allias dove after Alka.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 005] When Allias and Alka resurfaced, Alka continued to flail as Allias tried to push Alka towards shore. Alka shoved Allias again: “let me GO!” Alka started to fade again, and Allias struggled to keep Alka’s head above the water as Alka grew heavy in pain: “it’s cold…” This pain was crisp in Alka’s voice: “it’s so cold…” Alka seemed to be speaking to the clouds above: “where’s my-” Alka flailed again, smacking Allias in the face as Alka panicked: “my SHIP?!” It had taken Allias a very long time to rescue Alka. Allias had never been in the water for this long. The ocean is always cold and thoroughly empty. Alka had passed out again right before they got to the shore. And now, still shivering, Allias waits by the metal monster, strangely wanting more than anything for Alka to wake and say anything again. Allias thinks about how it’s strange to feel more lonely with a silent someone than with no one.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 006] Allias leans away from the screen and stands up, lost in a new thought. Looking for a distraction, Allias heads towards the observatory kitchen. The soup from this morning is still gently boiling, and Allias ladles some of it into a bowl, noticing the little bubbles, face just above the steam. The steam is warm, and it leaves a faint mark on a nearby window. Allias looks at the night sky outside the observatory, taking some time to think. The warmth is soft and soothing. All that had happened earlier stands pale when compared to the rest of Allias’ life. But Allias had never been through something like this. This occasion is certainly unique and momentous for Allias. Staring at the night sky, Allias ponders delicately over a difficult decision. After a thoughtful moment, Allias is sitting again next to the metal monster, fighting off the growing weight of sleep.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 007] It’s difficult to convey beauty in the passage of time when there is little to expect. It’s easy to fill a dull moment with aimless fidgeting or wandering thoughts. It’s hard to say nothing happened and just leave it at that, a blank page. Allias refuses to admit that life is often a blank page. There is a genuine truth in nothingness that people want to challenge. Nearly all people take this challenge, and the result of all this together creates something catastrophically beautiful.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 008] This silent waiting is taking a toll on Allias. It’s already tomorrow.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 009] This is the best place to start. This moment, when Allias decides to fully engage the monster, typing on the keyboard, staring at the dimmed screen, with Alka resting on the extremely comfortable bed beneath the dizzying bulk of observatory equipment, and this bulk, this monster, suddenly roaring to life at Allias’ command, but not in a machine-like way, rather more like an orchestral hum, the largest orchestra to ever exist, with every instrument tuning, but to different notes, and some of the instruments are people, a sizable choir, and one of the instruments seems to be playing its own melody, and then the holiday lights scattered throughout the observatory start to dim and flicker as the monster draws in more energy, and soon the noise collects itself and collapses into something pleasant, like the theme of a stream at the toes of several mountains, spinning around the roots of aged trees, and it starts to get dark, very dark, but pleasantly dark, like the dark of the excitement before a premiere of a film you’ve been forever wanting to see, or what the night sky feels like when you’re watching it with someone you love. As the theme continues, Allias leaves the screen and walks towards the bed where Alka rests. Allias lays on the bed next to Alka, both of them now beneath the monster, and Allias’ eyes close. This is the story of Allias’ decision.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 010] An auditorium. Almost every seat is taken by the time Allias arrives. Allias knows a few of the students sitting in this class, but the connection is only vague: a small, fleeting set of smiling faces that once wandered through the hallways of Allias’ memory. But Allias can’t see any of them right now. There are hundreds of students in this auditorium. And the lights are dimmed for some reason, as if a few movie trailers were about to play on the two massive projection screens at the front. Allias takes one of the few remaining seats in the back of the auditorium.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 011] The back of the auditorium. The door behind Allias swings open and slams against the wall, causing the students sitting nearby to jump a little, and some of them turn around. And then, when another student like them enters, they immediately relax and turn away. Alka is one of the last people to arrive for class. There is an open seat next to Allias, and Alka quickly takes it. Alka is in a little bit of a mess: disheveled clothing, wide eyes, and a backpack clutched aggressively in one hand. Allias doesn’t stare at Alka and only notices Alka’s phone. It’s an old model, and its screen is shattered. Alka places the phone on the armrest between the two of them.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 012] They don’t say anything to each other. The scene is new to both of them, and it’s taking them both a few tries to make sense of everything: numerous heads of varying hairstyles, new voices buried between unfamiliar words, that one lost student still searching for a seat, and a few people a few rows ahead furiously scrolling through maps on different devices. Nobody really knows anybody. The visible, eager, energetic fear seems to be shared by everyone at once. And then the auditorium goes dark. All the students immediately shut up as a dramatic, low, musical tone rolls across the darkness, and a voice rises and echoes above the noise. This noise crashes against all the walls in the auditorium, but the voice is warm and surprisingly energetic. It’s 8:00 AM.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 013] Then Alka slaps the armrest and keels over in pain. Allias, the only person nearby who can barely hear Alka above the introduction, looks worriedly at Alka but doesn’t have time to speak before Alka suddenly stands, still clutching the backpack, and nearly falls. Alka then hurries in the darkness towards the back door, nearly crashing into a wall. Alka then quietly slips out of the auditorium. Allias looks around. Nobody else seems to have noticed. Allias is immediately distracted by the voice as it suddenly bursts with enthusiasm, building an avalanche of words, capturing many of the thoughts stirring in all the students’ heads, speaking of the future, of challenges, of career, of adventure, of love, speaking until the musical number reaches a climax, and all the students are mesmerized as all the lights in the auditorium flash on. On stage, the professor stands in a welcoming pose, a microphone in hand. Nearly all the students are clapping now, and many start to laugh as the professor begins to bow animatedly. The two massive projection screens brightly snap to a clean greeting. This is Allias’ first day of college.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 014] Allias then looks at Alka’s empty seat and notices Alka’s phone. It had fallen off of the armrest and now sits alone, its shattered face barely visible beneath the seat. Without hesitation, Allias grabs the phone and rushes out of the auditorium. Nobody is in the hallways except for Alka and Allias. There are several lectures going on at once, and faint voices echo above the distant squeaking of Alka’s shoes against the floor. Allias catches the very last second of Alka, at the far end of the hallway, running and collapsing in some awkward half flip before plowing through a restroom door. Allias follows Alka.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 015] When Allias enters the restroom, Alka is already in a stall, vomiting into a toilet. The stall door is open, and Alka’s backpack had been dropped near the sinks. Allias stands still for a moment. Allias is familiar with the suspended feeling of being in a completely new place, having no idea where any of the doors lead, uncertain about which way home is, and it holds your breath slightly until the world has comfortably loaded itself into your brain. And, there’s another feeling when you know that you’ll be in this new place for a long time, long enough to develop intense memories. This is the feeling that makes one new place more distinct than other new places. Distinct enough to form the core of some people’s lives, possibly even a recurring setting for their dreams. People don’t notice these feelings until they happen, and sometimes, when they happen, they hit hard. Some people don’t like to talk about these feelings, and most people want to get over these feelings immediately. New places are temporarily discomforting by default. Allias thinks this discomfort is strangely pleasant. Allias approaches Alka with hesitation.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 016] Allias peeks near the open stall door and speaks: “Hi…?” Alka is slightly startled and turns to look at Allias. Then Alka turns back to the toilet and vomits again. Allias: “Are you ok?” Alka laughs into the toilet and groans: “it’s going GREAT.” Alka doesn’t turn back. Alka doesn’t move. Allias waits for a moment before extending Alka’s phone towards the body kneeling over the toilet: “You left this back there.” Alka turns and looks at the phone. Without hesitation, Alka takes the phone and whips it across the room. The phone smashes against a wall and tumbles somewhere. Allias shoots Alka a worried look: “What are you doing?! Why?” Alka leans back, rips out a wad of toilet paper, and scoots backwards on the floor towards a wall: “hey. can you toss my backpack over here?” The toilet flushes itself.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 017] Allias pulls Alka’s backpack towards the wall, closer to Alka. Alka hugs the backpack and manages a small smile: “thanks.” Allias stands there for a moment before asking: “Do you want help? Maybe water?” Alka runs a finger across the grooves between the elegant tiling and then looks up at the chandeliers: “this… is the nicest bathroom that could ever exist. i like it here.” Allias also notices the chandeliers and takes a small step back in silent awe. The ceilings are impressively high for a restroom, and the chandeliers are designed like stairwells going in all directions. Everything is spotless and sparkling. Allias: “Yeah, it’s hard to believe. Everything on this campus is just like this.” Alka: “huh. maybe we’re dreaming. i certainly wish i was.” Allias thinks about this. Alka looks at Allias: “what brought you here?” Allias answers with a modest hint of excitement: “I’m studying computer science.” Alka slaps the tiling: “no, what are you doing here? this bathroom? right now? lecture’s still going, you’re missing out.” Allias takes a small step back: “I was about to- I thought you… well actually…” Alka, still sitting on the floor: “what? who are you?” Allias glances at the elegant frames around the mirrors above the sinks. They don’t quite register in Allias’ mind. Alka is still on the floor, and Allias doesn’t want to abandon Alka like this. There’s something that could be said. Allias carefully asks: “…I think I just want to talk, just for a moment?”
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 018] Alka leans back against the patterned tiling on the wall and looks straight ahead: “hm.” It’s silent for a moment, and Allias decides to stay and wait. Alka takes a breath before speaking: “i can’t get any of it out of my head.” Allias sits on the floor: “What is it?” Alka continues to look straight ahead, delivering nonchalantly: “the way my dog died. it’s still vivid in my mind.” Allias: “Oh…” Alka’s tone changes: “but that’s not what’s throwing me off right now. it hurts still, but, i’ve been trying to call my parents, ever since they dropped me off. they’re not responding. and that’s not normal. my parents aren’t like that. i love my parents, they’re good people. but our home… they live in the middle of nowhere. maybe they… i don’t know. they dropped me off here a week ago.”
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 019] A full body’s length of empty air sits between them. Allias wonders if Alka had spent most of the week like this. Allias wonders what more had happened the week prior. Allias wonders what might take Alka’s mind off of this. Allias wonders what the dog’s name was. Allias doesn’t know what to say. Allias wonders why people don’t always find the right words, which is strange when there are seemingly infinite ways of putting words together. Allias also wonders why people sometimes expect words to be said regardless of how effective they are. Sometimes most of the difficulty comes not with which words to use but rather in how the words will be received, be it in empty promises, muddy reassurance, or a relatable story. Especially when little is known, words can fall anywhere between destructive and healing, regardless of the initial intent.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 020] And then, suddenly, from the other end of the fancy restroom, Alka’s phone begins to ring, and the ringtone is loud. It’s also pretty groovy. It’s from a part of a song that Allias has never heard before. It plays for a short moment before Alka eventually rises from the floor and walks to the phone, and the sound of rubber soles slightly slashing against the tile bounces off the walls, clashing against the ringtone. Allias starts to stand up, watching from a short distance. Alka picks up the shattered phone and answers it on its last ring, glancing once at Allias: “…hello? …ma? hi… yeah. no, i didn’t… no, i’m ok. yeah… ok, yeah. ok, ok. bye.” Alka puts away the phone.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 021] It’s quiet for a moment before Allias asks: “Was that-” Alka interrupts Allias: “what’s your name?” Allias is thrown off: “What?” Alka is looking at Allias: “what’s your name.” Allias takes a second: “…Allias (AH-lee-is).” Alka starts to walk off: “alright. i’m alka (AHL-ka). i’m going now.” Alka’s sudden change of mood surprises Allias. Allias reflects over the idea of Alka simply walking off, as if nothing had happened. As if Alka hadn’t just vomited. Allias: “Where are you going? Alka?” Alka glances at the massive clock cabinet in the corner of the restroom: “anywhere. maybe food.” Allias also turns to look at the massive clock cabinet in the corner of the restroom: “But class isn’t over yet…?” They both briefly admire the expensive clock. There are 40 minutes left in class. Alka: “it’s up to you, allias. are you hungry?” As Alka walks towards the door, Allias calls after Alka: “Wait.”
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 022] Alka wakes up. Something metal whirls and retracts away from Alka’s face, and little lights are blinking everywhere around Alka. For a moment, Alka lays there, on the comfortable bed, staring blankly. Alka is completely surrounded by machinery, and it is overwhelmingly unfamiliar. The tension in Alka’s head grows quickly until Alka freaks out and throws a punch at the monster. Everything starts to move at once, and the monster’s cables and metal arms instantly retract from Alka. Alka rolls and tumbles out of the bed and crashes onto the floor, and a sudden, searing pain fills Alka’s stomach. Alka looks down. There is a massive bandage over Alka’s entire midsection.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 023] The observatory. Groaning, Alka leans back and grabs the edge of the bed, looking around. The early morning sunlight peeks through the equipment, but the holiday lights are still on. Some of the lights dangle from the observatory ceiling, and some of the lights drop down to the floor around Alka and wrap neatly around dozens and dozens of potted plants. Nearly all the plants are flowering. Half of the flowers are colorful geraniums, and all of the flowers are blooming wildly. Alka pushes away from the bed, looking around before hurrying in a confused stumble out of the monster, following the vague rays of the sunrise.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 024] Alka eventually starts to run, bumping into metal sections of the monster and stumbling over the potted flowers. Then Alka sees Allias. Allias is sitting at a small dining table in the kitchen, already waiting for Alka. Alka stops and stands at a distance, eyes locked in terrified confusion at Allias. And then, before Allias has a chance to explain, Alka launches into a sprint and tackles Allias. Allias blindly throws both hands forward in fear: “Wait! AaaAAA-” The two of them slam into the kitchen table, brutally demolishing it, and Alka recovers in a chaotic flip. Allias yelps and crashes against the kitchen stove, and the pot of soup shakes a little.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 025] Alka stumbles a little before launching again at Allias: “take me BACK!” Allias, on the floor, throws both hands in the air: “What?! Help! I helped!” Alka blindly trips over a piece of the shattered kitchen table and violently falls face-flat, further shattering what remains of the table. Allias scoots away from the loud mess, hands still up: “I sent a message, to the Space Mail Service! They’re sending a ship!” Alka rolls over on the floor in pain, gripping the bandages around Alka’s midsection. The bandages have gone a little red. Alka, still clearly confused, manages to sit up on the floor: “…what?” Allias remains on the floor at a distance: “Do you remember? You crashed your spaceship, in the ocean. I tried to rescue you…” Alka immediately stands and scans the observatory for an exit, stumbling: “my SHIP!”
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 026] Alka spots the observatory door and sprints again. Allias watches: “Do you know where you’re going?!” Alka shoves the door open and looks outside: “my ship! in the OCEAN.” Alka runs out of the observatory. Allias: “There’s no way-” The observatory door clicks shut. Allias sits alone in the observatory.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 027] Alka runs across the sand and stops before the shoreline. The ocean is quiet and calm, and there’s a soft mist in the air. The silent sunrise fills this mist. Alka leans over and touches the ocean. It’s freezing. Alka looks with fixed intent at some random point in the distance. Alka then takes a few steps back, runs, and leaps as far as humanly possible into the ocean. The beach is very short, and the sand stops immediately before a submerged ledge, a sharp drop into cold, total darkness. Alka stares with wide eyes into the deep nothingness. Finding the spaceship now would be impossible. Alka then resurfaces, splashing in the ocean, gasping, and screams.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 028] It’s not long before Alka is back on shore, running along the perimeter of the island, shivering, eyes following the shoreline. The sun is a little higher now, and the mist is starting to clear. Alka continues to run. Alka usually finds it difficult to understand why many people are happy to stay in one place for most of their lives. When the span of the world seems infinite, it’s confusing to see that only few aimlessly wander. When people come across a tiny part of the world that feels comforting, many find it hard to believe that there could be millions of places out there that come close to or even exceed that level of comfort. From the world outside their bedroom to the world outside all boundaries, the entirety of the world outside their own is summarized into the limited glimpse of what they’ve seen and know. But most people don’t have a choice. Alka continues to run, shivering. After many moments like this in Alka’s life, Alka wonders: maybe they’re correct. In the deep, infinite ocean there are many beautiful gems, but the ocean is so deep and infinite that the gems might as well not exist. Several hours in the ocean can do anything to a person. Alka continues to run, not exactly knowing why.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 029] It is easier to cross a physical distance than a mental one. They are both distances that every person crosses for the entirety of life, and every person has different ways of crossing them. Rarely do the distances reach the same destination. Many people are happy in the world of their minds, whether they honestly like it or not, and some find fulfillment in sharing theirs with others. But when minds become conflicted, many people tend to find the first opportunity to cross a physical distance, avoiding the mental bridge, because the pain in the hostile tampering or destruction of all the thoughts and memories that define you likely rivals that of which the greatest physical torment achieves. Sometimes some people unwillingly go through the effort of pushing everyone away and then cry for themselves, despite being merely a few minutes away from the next nearest person. There is no meaningful correlation between physical and mental distance. Some people don’t even understand themselves, and some people don’t realize that they don’t understand themselves. And then there are those who simply could care less about the holes in their world and don’t mind the sinking. It’s just a destination, and all the people together create a beautiful map.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 030] At the end of the day, Alka had completed a loop around the entire island. Alka had found nothing but sand, ocean, grass, and rock. The island is almost entirely flat. Alka now walks slowly, eyes tiredly pointed towards the observatory. Allias is sitting in the sand just outside the observatory, watching the sunset.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 031] Alka approaches Allias. The color of the sunset is warm. Alka’s voice carries above the water hugging the shoreline: “is this all this planet is? this island, that building… and that miserable ocean?” Allias continues to watch the sunset: “Sit down.” Alka glances around: “are you really alone here? you don’t have any way off of this planet?” Allias continues to watch the sunset: “Hey, sit down, right here.” Allias pats the sand. After a moment, Alka sits down. Allias seems more tired than Alka. Allias continues to watch the sunset: “What do you remember? Do you remember anything?” Alka then looks at the observatory and points at it: “how long was i in there?” Allias: “Only two nights. What do you remember?”
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 032] Alka looks at the sunset. Alka takes a breath before speaking: “i was delivering packages. then my ship ran out of fuel. this was the longest delivery i’ve ever done… there would’ve been a big paycheck.” Allias: “What were you delivering?” Alka: “i just deliver the packages. it’s not my business to know what’s inside them.” Allias continues to watch the sunset: “How many packages?” Alka: “i don’t know, too many. i didn’t count them. by the time i got here, there was only one left. i don’t like to keep track of the time between the stars.” Allias is reminded of the chilling void that makes up most of outer space: “So you’re a space pilot? Can’t the space ships fly themselves?” Alka immediately recites, almost jokingly: “we provide a personal, unparalleled experience as a standard for our delivery service.” The water hugging the shoreline is nearly as calm as the sun. Allias: “Do you remember anything else?” Alka answers collectedly: “that’s all that happened.” Allias: “Not even dreams?” Alka looks hollowly at Allias: “is this a joke?” Allias continues to watch the sunset. Alka sighs: “i haven’t dreamt in years.”
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 033] They both watch the sunset quietly for a moment. As the sun starts to dip lower into the ocean, Allias seems more relaxed and starts to stand up: “I can’t believe you spent the entire day running around this island… you haven’t eaten anything all day. Are you hungry?” Alka doesn’t get up: “when will my people arrive?” Allias: “What?” Alka: “this morning, you said you sent a message.” Allias: “Oh, the Space Mail Service. I’ll show you the transcript. I’m not sure when they’ll arrive.” Allias starts to walk towards the observatory. Alka continues to watch the sunset. Allias then stops and looks back: “Are you alright?”
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 034] Alka vaguely points at the observatory: “that awful mess inside that building… what is it?” Allias speaks thoughtfully: “That project… it took centuries, and countless people worked on it. It’s completed now. But it’s easier to experience it in person than to describe it.” When Alka doesn’t respond, Allias starts to walk towards the observatory again, this time not stopping when Alka doesn’t follow. Allias is not sure what Alka is thinking. Allias calls back to Alka: “You can stay out here if you want… it’s safe everywhere on the planet.” Alka, still sitting on the sand, calls after Allias: “hey, what’s your name?” Allias, at a distance, stops walking: “Allias. And yours?” Alka: “alka.” Alka seems to be staring at the darkening sky as if it were an empty wall: “it’s beautiful out here, allias.” There is a very subtle warmth that briefly lingers in the sand at the end of the day. Allias walks back to the observatory, and Alka sits on the sand until the warmth fades away.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 035] The campus lawn. It’s morning, and the sunlight fills the trees and scatters over well-trimmed grass. A quiet breeze occasionally flickers the leaves, and all of the leaves are bright green. There aren’t many students on the campus lawn, since most of them are still in class right now. Alka and Allias are walking to the campus dining hall.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 036] Alka is wearing a pullover hooded sweater. The sweater is a little faded and has no print on it, but it is the softest fabric Alka has ever worn. This sweater belongs to Allias. Allias lent the sweater to Alka right before Alka tried walking out of the restroom with a vomit-stained shirt. Allias had noticed the very unique picture printed on Alka’s shirt, but Allias couldn’t understand what it was. Allias’ sweater and shirt are nearly the same color, while Alka’s shirt does not match the sweater at all. Alka is currently preoccupied with the cuffs of the sweater: “this is too real. i can’t believe they can make clothing this soft. you’re probably not going to get this back.” Allias is squinting at the small panels next to the buildings, trying to find the one labeled for dining: “You can have it. I have three more sweaters exactly like that in my dorm.” There are a lot of geese on the lawn. Alka: “which dorm did you choose?” Allias: “The one by the lake.” Alka: “no way… isn’t that the oldest building on this campus?” Allias looks at the geese: “I don’t know. I just like the lake.” Alka: “don’t you have to walk to another building just to do laundry in that dorm?” Allias wonders what the geese are thinking: “I don’t mind the walk.” Alka is still preoccupied with the cuffs of the sweater: “huh. i’ve really got to check out this lake.”
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 037] The campus dining hall. Alka and Allias enter through two sets of intricately carved wooden double doors. They walk into a grand hallway with intricately carved wooden columns, each rising to the roof of the building. The two furthest columns feature beautiful grand staircases. The building is five floors tall, and each floor features a unique buffet. A summary of the menu is displayed on a large, colorful touch screen in the middle of the hallway. Alka stops to watch the menu gradually animate through a list of showcase dishes, and Allias continues to walk off to the nearest buffet table, eyes locked on a steaming metal cauldron. By the time Alka walks away from the menu screen, Allias is holding a bowl of oatmeal. Allias scans the nearby dining tables: “Where do you want to sit?” Alka notices the bowl in Allias’ hands and furiously points at it: “that’s it? you’ve got a greater immediate selection of food than nearly every person on earth… and you decide on OATMEAL? you better get something else or i’m leaving you here.” Allias looks dejectedly at the bowl of oatmeal.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 038] Allias and Alka agree to walk by every buffet table on all five floors in the dining hall. After touring the fifth floor, they find two seats with a nice view overlooking the campus. The campus is generally surrounded by heavy forest on one side and a prairie on the other. A large lake sits at the edge of the campus, comfortably enveloped within the forest. There is a small city barely visible at the other edge of campus, and a few more towns are clustered even further away. The tallest building in sight is the auditorium that Alka and Allias had just walked from. Allias watches as Alka carefully lowers two crowded plates of food onto the table. The plates are a messy collection of small bits taken from nearly every available dish they walked by. Allias had already finished the bowl of oatmeal during this walk up through the dining hall. Allias now holds a mug of hot chocolate and focuses on the clouds in the horizon.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 039] At the moment, Allias and Alka are the only people on the fifth floor. This dining table that Allias and Alka have chosen feels like an eagle’s nest, tucked within one of the most beautiful places overlooking the campus. It is partially secluded, only because most students avoid the long trip up the grand staircases to the fifth floor. The sunlight is bright and filling, and it quietly warms the faces of Allias and Alka. They both notice this, but neither of them acknowledge it.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 040] They don’t speak until Alka finishes one of the two plates. Alka appears particularly ordinary now, and Allias is still reflecting on the drastic change in Alka’s mood over the past hour. Allias asks: “When’s your next class?” Alka focuses on an omelette while speaking: “i don’t have another lecture until tomorrow. i’ll probably see you there, since it’s for the same class from earlier, in the auditorium.” Allias lifts an empty mug and prepares to leave: “I’ve got one soon. I should probably leave now.” Alka is focused on cutting through the omelette with a fork: “yeah go ahead.” Allias rises from the dining table but decides to ask Alka another question: “Is there anything else bothering you?” Alka laughs and points the fork at the omelette: “i’m bothered that you didn’t get anything else besides oatmeal.” Allias, now standing, places the empty mug on the table in front of Alka: “What about this?” Alka looks away from the omelette and glances at the mug: “that doesn’t count. is that really all you’ll try? you are most definitely missing out.” Allias points at the mug: “I got exactly what I wanted, and I enjoyed it.” Alka: “oatmeal is not a personality.” Allias: “What?” Alka: “what else do you want me to say?” Allias points at Alka’s two plates: “We each know what we want. You knew what you wanted, so that’s what you got, right?” Alka takes a bite of omelette: “no. i don’t have the slightest idea.” Allias: “What?” Alka points the fork at the two plates: “look at this, this here. i couldn’t possibly know what i’d like out of everything if i didn’t know what anything in everything was.” Allias: “…What?”
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 041] Allias notices that first conversations don’t often reveal who people really are. Curiously, given enough effort, it is unfairly simple to describe all the thoughts that amount to one person, but it is rarely the priority to summarize these thoughts as they are. People rather tend to describe themselves in the same way films or video games are promoted, in spirit of trailers or cover art: carefully crafted to make people think a certain way, hiding some key elements, sometimes focusing on relatable or alluring features, sometimes focusing on connections to other famous people or ideas, and sometimes staying completely vague. But there are the rare people who, beginning from the first encounter, will describe themselves thoroughly, disregarding spoilers, unafraid of their immediate vulnerability, and these people tend to be the most precious of the ridiculous. At the same time, Allias thinks there is no meaningful correlation between those who are good at talking and those who are just good people.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 042] Alka stops eating and puts down the fork: “alright. enough about me, what do you want? who are you?” Allias starts to walk off again: “Can you ask me again later? I’ve got to get to class soon.” Alka: “i have no idea who you are.” Allias: “I just don’t-” Alka: “just ONE thing.” Allias stops, sighs, and answers the question: “I want to make video games.” Alka then looks at what remains of the omelette: “ah. so we’re both clueless.” Allias makes a face of curious frustration: “What does that mean?” Alka gestures towards the scenery surrounding both of them, looking at Allias: “the real world’s already enough. if you’re so into escaping, you’re missing out on more meaningful things.” Allias starts to walk away again, now obviously preoccupied with a different thought: “That’s nice, Alka.” Alka watches as Allias walks away, and right before Allias descends down the grand staircases, Alka insists: “you’re a naked mole-rat, allias.” Allias pauses and looks back with a strange face: “I’m a… what?” Alka stabs the omelette: “burying yourself in your own world. i don’t know.” Allias glances past Alka at the clouds in the horizon, laughing in confusion: “Don’t ever call me that again.” Alka laughs and chokes on the omelette as Allias walks away. But Alka doesn’t know that Allias isn’t walking to class. Allias doesn’t have class until tomorrow. Allias is free.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 043] The observatory kitchen. Allias ladles some soup into a large bowl and passes it along with a spoon to Alka. Allias then walks over to the monster and starts to type on its keyboard. Alka, following just behind Allias, inspects the soup before trying a spoonful. Alka has never tasted soup like this before. Alka takes another spoonful. Allias steps back and points at the computer screen: “Here’s your transcript.” Alka approaches the screen and ponders over the recorded conversation between Allias and the Space Mail Service. By the time Alka finishes reading through the transcript, Alka is holding an empty bowl.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 044] Alka steps back and stares at the last line of the transcript: “back home, one of my lifetime friends is getting married. i was hoping i’d get back before the wedding. looks like i’m going to miss it.” Allias taps on the keyboard, closing the transcript. All that now remains on the screen is an animated logo. Allias then looks at Alka: “Did you also want to send a message?” Alka looks around the observatory: “no, the transcript’s fine.” The monster is quietly humming, and the nighttime sky fills all of the windows in the observatory. In the kitchen, what remains of the table now sits in a neatly organized pile of broken pieces. Allias notices Alka absently looking through the observatory: “There isn’t much to do on this planet.” Alka is still holding the empty bowl: “yeah, i figured.” Allias points at the monster: “Most of my time is spent in there. Do you want to see how it works?” Alka looks at the monster.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 045] Alka then glances through the windows at the nighttime sky before facing Allias: “how long will it take?” Allias starts to walk towards the monster: “As long as you want. It’s up to you.” Allias continues walking, and Alka decides to follow, both of them passing between the walls of metal. When they reach the bed beneath the monster, Allias gracefully rolls onto it, leaving a respectful amount of space for Alka. Alka looks at the bed with doubt. Allias, noticing Alka’s expression, assures Alka: “It’s really up to you.” Alka looks at the metal arms and cables above Allias: “can you prove this is safe?” Allias points at the monster: “You’ll be fine, nothing here can hurt you. And I’ll be with you the whole time.” Alka looks carefully at Allias. The expression on Allias’ face is transparently calm, a tired kind of calm, and a hint of relief lingers on the eyes of Allias, and a thought strikes Alka. Alka grips the empty bowl: “you saved my life, right?” Allias: “I would never let anybody die like that.” Alka trusts Allias but silently looks up at the holiday lights dangling from the ceiling, taking a careful moment to appreciate the bright, colorful scene as if it were the last thing Alka was ever going to see. Alka places the empty bowl on the floor next to a nearby potted plant and rolls onto the bed next to Allias. Nothing happens for a moment. Both of them stare at the cables and metal humming inches away, occasionally distracted by the blinking lights. Alka frowns: “now what?” Allias: “Just relax.” The monster starts to roar to life.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 046] Suddenly Alka and Allias are standing in empty space. Alka can’t see the floor that they’re standing on, but they are both weighted to it. Alka looks above, and then Alka looks below. It feels as if there are two skies: a deep black sky high above and a wide white sky down below. Nothing else. Allias watches as Alka starts to walk around: “How are you doing?” Allias’ voice does not echo. Alka looks at Allias with a curious expression: “where are we?” Allias takes a step away from Alka: “Here, try this: imagine a place, maybe recall a memory. It’ll be easier if it’s a strong memory. Preferably a good one.” Alka doesn’t take very long to recall: “i remember my first piano lesson.” Allias lights up a little: “Oh, you play the piano?” Alka: “no, i don’t. i hate it. but that was the time i first met that lifetime friend, the one getting married. when we met, we were both still kids.”
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 047] The empty space flips into a music store. Alka and Allias are both immediately younger and now stand next to various sets of shiny drums. There’s a person sitting behind a short welcoming counter by the front door. The counter is surrounded by various small pedals, plugs, and panels. The person behind the counter isn’t paying much attention to Alka or Allias. The two children stand in the middle of the store, taking in the scene. Young Allias whispers to young Alka: “Whether or not anyone notices me is up to you. But I won’t do anything.” Alka nods. They can both hear pianos playing from somewhere in the back of the store. A busy city can be partially seen past the guitars displayed against the storefront windows. The music store is very, very small, and it seems to be tucked into the middle of the city. Once every few days, the people in the city will usually hear the distant launch of a spacecraft. Alka starts to walk towards the piano rooms in the back of the store.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 048] There are four cheap chairs crammed next to each other in the small hallway outside the piano rooms. There are only three piano rooms, and the lights are on in only two of these rooms. There are small vertical windows in the doors, and it’s clear how there’s barely enough space in each room for the teacher, piano, and student. The doors don’t do a very good job of blocking out the sound. The hallway is filled with the muffled, clashing sound of two children playing different pianos at the same time. Alka walks up to the first chair in the hallway and struggles to get into it. Young Alka is very short. The young version of Alka’s lifetime friend sits in the third chair, and the parent of this friend sits in the fourth. The parent and the child are peering over a spiral notebook, and they’re taking turns, drawing on it with a plump crayon.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 049] Memories change as the brain ages. This even applies to the fondest, strongest memories. Alka has not yet realized this. It is just the nature of the brain, each time the memory is replayed. Sometimes the memories only shift slightly, quietly changing the color of the sky or the way that one person said that phrase. Sometimes the memories fade so much that the only remnant is a vague feeling of a place that once was. And sometimes the memory rises from an event that didn’t even occur at all. The brain serves one person, and one person only. It will do whatever it takes to serve this person, no matter if this person agrees with the brain or not. Alka is experiencing the memory right now as if it were happening once again, exactly as it was, and it’s somehow loaded with more detail than Alka could possibly remember. This thought hasn’t occurred to Alka yet.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 050] The parent notices Alka sitting alone, watching the notebook, and when the child tries to pass the crayon to the parent, the parent takes the crayon and extends it to Alka. The child is slightly surprised and looks at Alka. Alka takes the crayon and grips it, staring at the crayon for a moment. The parent: “Is this your first time here?” Alka nods. The parent: “What’s your name?” Alka: “alka.” The parent tells the child to pass the notebook to Alka. Alka looks at the drawing.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 051] The drawing is literally just scribbles.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 052] Alka makes a strange face at the drawing: “this is useless!” This makes the child furious: “No it’s not! It’s going to make me forget about DEATH!” The parent immediately panics a little and hushes the child, looking worriedly at Alka. Alka is staring quietly at the drawing. The parent asks Alka: “Alka, are you excited to learn the piano?” Alka doesn’t respond. Alka continues to stare at the page of scribbles, waiting for it to evoke a different response out of Alka. Alka frowns, still gripping the crayon. The parent: “Alka…?”
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 053] Alka turns to a fresh page in the notebook and starts to run the plump crayon over the paper. All three people sitting in the hallway watch as the color gently lays parts of itself on the page. Time flies as they listen beyond the jarred piano keys to the subtle skimming of the crayon’s leading edge, and none of them are thinking about how the crayon’s lifespan is gradually diminishing. They don’t worry about how the marks on the page will never return to the crayon ever again. They simply watch how Alka holds the crayon against the page, how the crayon seamlessly answers, and how the page gives slightly with every pass. Alka’s drawing is naturally unremarkable. None of the three people can make out what it is that Alka is drawing, but at the moment it isn’t important what the drawing is, and the parent smiles, noticing how the two children are deeply captivated by the whirling color on the notebook. To them, the entire world has briefly been reduced to whatever is happening on this notebook. The parent and child don’t say a word as Alka starts to lose track of time. Alka scribbles away almost blindly now, letting the crayon aimlessly follow the jarred notes spilling out of the piano rooms, quietly clashing with the lines it previously drew, and after a while Alka forgets why Alka is even sitting here.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 054] And then Alka suddenly jumps out of the chair, panicking: “allias?!” Alka whips the notebook and crayon aside, and the notebook slaps the child in the face, startling both the parent and child. The parent stands up, hands extended in a worried panic, trying to settle both Alka and the now crying child. Alka darts away from the parent and crashes into a drum set: “allias?! i want out! HELP-” The space flips, and the monster promptly returns Alka and Allias to the bed. Alka wakes up, staring at the cables and metal again. Alka doesn’t say a word. Allias is nearby, also awake, also on the bed: “Are you alright?” Both of them are laying on the bed, motionless, their bodies at peace. Allias turns to Alka and explains quickly: “You will return, without fail, whenever you want to leave. Even if something goes wrong, you will be automatically returned after a time limit of a few days.” Alka is still silent. Allias continues, bleeding with excitement: “And it’s only been a few minutes out here… time does flow differently when inside, but it’s also not infinite, and it’s limited by your brain. This machine does try to make it easier for the brain to handle. But it’s not like all those sci-fi movies. You can’t get lost. And it’s impossible to actually get injured or die. It’s like dreaming, but better.”
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 055] Alka doesn’t respond, still staring at the cables and metal. Allias isn’t sure what Alka is thinking, but Allias is clearly worried about this response. Allias wonders if this was all too much. Allias asks again: “Alka? Are you alright?” Then Alka glances at Allias, turns away, and rolls out of the bed: “…i’m just tired.” Allias also rolls off of the bed and watches as Alka walks towards the observatory door: “Where are you going?” Alka doesn’t respond, and Allias follows Alka. Alka pushes through the door and sits on the sand, facing the ocean. All the stars are visible in the night sky. Allias leans outside of the observatory, holding the door open. When Alka doesn’t move from the sand, Allias decides against calling out and returns into the observatory, letting the door close. Allias stands still for a moment, casting a blank gaze at the floor. Allias feels bad, unsure of what had happened with Alka. Allias decides to leave Alka alone. Outside of the observatory, Alka curls up on the sand, eventually falling asleep. A few moments later, Allias exits the observatory and gently throws a blanket over Alka.

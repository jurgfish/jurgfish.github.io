        <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 001] As the sun sets, a soft sheet of golden sunlight settles across a peaceful island. An ocean softly curls around this island, around and around, slowly circling across the entire planet. Resting on one shore of this island is one solitary building, the only building on this planet. It is an observatory, and for years this has been the home of just one person. However, at the moment, there are two people on this planet. Allias drags Alka through the observatory door, both of them dripping wet. A burnt and torn uniform clings to Alka’s limp body. The door clicks shut behind them. The sunset peeks through the observatory windows and casts shadows of Allias and Alka across the equipment in the observatory, sending flickers of golden gray across the metal, and the light rays fill the droplets flung from their soaked clothing. The shadows all fall when Allias slips, and Allias and Alka slam into the floor. The thud echoes within the observatory. Allias, shivering, pushes up against the floor and looks back in dread at Alka’s silent body. There’s nobody else to ask for help. Allias rises and continues to drag Alka, ignoring the feeling of faint, ignoring the red streak on the floor behind Alka, ignoring how neither of them know each other, and ignoring the pot of soup that has been gently boiling in the observatory’s kitchen since today’s sunrise.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 002] Allias drags Alka into the heart of the observatory, where a monstrous bulk of metal rises to the domed ceiling. The sun has now completely set, and many sets of holiday lights carefully draped across the equipment have flickered on, synchronized to a small timer Allias had set several years ago. The little lights make all the metal panels shine in several subtle colors. It isn’t long before Allias is sitting at the edge of this bulk of metal, scanning a dimmed computer screen. Allias can’t tell if Alka will survive. Alka is now out of sight, resting on an extremely comfortable bed, several meters away from Allias. This bed, the centerpiece of the observatory, lies directly beneath the bulk of metal, and an elegant monstrosity of cables and metal arms envelopes the bed in a jungle of technology so complex anyone could stare at it forever and still notice something new. This used to bother Allias, but after several years of work, Allias had found that this metal monster was already in its simplest, most minimal state, and Allias had to insist, for Allias’ own sanity, that no, this is not the work of an evil scientist, alien species, or top dollar sci-fi film studio, and yes, every piece has a meaningful, refined purpose. But this isn’t a typical observatory.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 003] This elegant metal monster wasn’t designed to bring people back to life. While one of its certain purposes is to keep people alive, its true purpose is far more intimate. At the moment, all Allias can do is wait. The monster makes a soothing, whirling noise in the background as it computes. Allias absently watches a little logo animate on the monster’s computer screen. Allias had already noticed the logo printed on the breast of Alka’s uniform: now scorched, but in happy, bold letters, the initials of the Space Mail Service. Allias was not expecting a delivery. Whatever the delivery was, it is now tucked within what remains of a derpy little spaceship, now lost to the depths of this planet’s ocean.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 004] Earlier, when the spaceship crashed, the wreck stayed afloat long enough for Allias to swim out and rescue Alka. Alka had been severely injured upon impact. Alka had also passed out, and Allias was surprised to find Alka mostly intact. Had Allias not been there, Alka would have drifted down to the bottom of the ocean. It was eerily calm right after Allias began to swim back to shore. Allias was barely managing to tow the limp Alka, but this rescue quickly became ridiculously difficult when Alka suddenly woke, took one look at Allias, and panicked: “…what is THIS?!” They both began to sink as Alka flailed: “this isn’t…” Alka sharply inhaled in pain and then gasped for air as Allias tried to get Alka to calm down. Alka shoved Allias: “NO!!” Alka then faded  out and sank, and Allias dove after Alka.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 005] When Allias and Alka resurfaced, Alka continued to flail as Allias tried to push Alka towards shore. Alka shoved Allias again: “let me GO!” Alka started to fade again, and Allias struggled to keep Alka’s head above the water as Alka grew heavy in pain: “it’s cold…” This pain was crisp in Alka’s voice: “it’s so cold…” Alka seemed to be speaking to the clouds above: “where’s my-” Alka flailed again, smacking Allias in the face as Alka panicked: “my SHIP?!” It had taken Allias a very long time to rescue Alka. Allias had never been in the water for this long. The ocean is always cold and thoroughly empty. Alka had passed out again right before they got to the shore. And now, still shivering, Allias waits by the metal monster, strangely wanting more than anything for Alka to wake and say anything again. Allias thinks about how it’s strange to feel more lonely with a silent someone than with no one.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 006] Allias leans away from the screen and stands up, lost in a new thought. Looking for a distraction, Allias heads towards the observatory kitchen. The soup from this morning is still gently boiling, and Allias ladles some of it into a bowl, noticing the little bubbles, face just above the steam. The steam is warm, and it leaves a faint mark on a nearby window. Allias looks at the night sky outside the observatory, taking some time to think. The warmth is soft and soothing. All that had happened earlier stands pale when compared to the rest of Allias’ life. But Allias had never been through something like this. This occasion is certainly unique and momentous for Allias. Staring at the night sky, Allias ponders delicately over a difficult decision. After a thoughtful moment, Allias is sitting again next to the metal monster, fighting off the growing weight of sleep.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 007] It’s difficult to convey beauty in the passage of time when there is little to expect. It’s easy to fill a dull moment with aimless fidgeting or wandering thoughts. It’s hard to say nothing happened and just leave it at that, a blank page. Allias refuses to admit that life is often a blank page. There is a genuine truth in nothingness that people want to challenge. Nearly all people take this challenge, and the result of all this together creates something catastrophically beautiful.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 008] This silent waiting is taking a toll on Allias. It’s already tomorrow.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 009] This is the best place to start. This moment, when Allias decides to fully engage the monster, typing on the keyboard, staring at the dimmed screen, with Alka resting on the extremely comfortable bed beneath the dizzying bulk of observatory equipment, and this bulk, this monster, suddenly roaring to life at Allias’ command, but not in a machine-like way, rather more like an orchestral hum, the largest orchestra to ever exist, with every instrument tuning, but to different notes, and some of the instruments are people, a sizable choir, and one of the instruments seems to be playing its own melody, and then the holiday lights scattered throughout the observatory start to dim and flicker as the monster draws in more energy, and soon the noise collects itself and collapses into something pleasant, like the theme of a stream at the toes of several mountains, spinning around the roots of aged trees, and it starts to get dark, very dark, but pleasantly dark, like the dark of the excitement before a premiere of a film you’ve been forever wanting to see, or what the night sky feels like when you’re watching it with someone you love. As the theme continues, Allias leaves the screen and walks towards the bed where Alka rests. Allias lays on the bed next to Alka, both of them now beneath the monster, and Allias’ eyes close. This is the story of Allias’ decision.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 010] An auditorium. Almost every seat is taken by the time Allias arrives. Allias knows a few of the students sitting in this class, but the connection is only vague: a small, fleeting set of smiling faces that once wandered through the hallways of Allias’ memory. But Allias can’t see any of them right now. There are hundreds of students in this auditorium. And the lights are dimmed for some reason, as if a few movie trailers were about to play on the two massive projection screens at the front. Allias takes one of the few remaining seats in the back of the auditorium.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 011] The back of the auditorium. The door behind Allias swings open and slams against the wall, causing the students sitting nearby to jump a little, and some of them turn around. And then, when another student like them enters, they immediately relax and turn away. Alka is one of the last people to arrive for class. There is an open seat next to Allias, and Alka quickly takes it. Alka is in a little bit of a mess: disheveled clothing, wide eyes, and a backpack clutched aggressively in one hand. Allias doesn’t stare at Alka and only notices Alka’s phone. It’s an old model, and its screen is shattered. Alka places the phone on the armrest between the two of them.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 012] They don’t say anything to each other. The scene is new to both of them, and it’s taking them both a few tries to make sense of everything: numerous heads of varying hairstyles, new voices buried between unfamiliar words, that one lost student still searching for a seat, and a few people a few rows ahead furiously scrolling through maps on different devices. Nobody really knows anybody. The visible, eager, energetic fear seems to be shared by everyone at once. And then the auditorium goes dark. All the students immediately shut up as a dramatic, low, musical tone rolls across the darkness, and a voice rises and echoes above the noise. This noise crashes against all the walls in the auditorium, but the voice is warm and surprisingly energetic. It’s 8:00 AM.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 013] Then Alka slaps the armrest and keels over in pain. Allias, the only person nearby who can barely hear Alka above the introduction, looks worriedly at Alka but doesn’t have time to speak before Alka suddenly stands, still clutching the backpack, and nearly falls. Alka then hurries in the darkness towards the back door, nearly crashing into a wall. Alka then quietly slips out of the auditorium. Allias looks around. Nobody else seems to have noticed. Allias is immediately distracted by the voice as it suddenly bursts with enthusiasm, building an avalanche of words, capturing many of the thoughts stirring in all the students’ heads, speaking of the future, of challenges, of career, of adventure, of love, speaking until the musical number reaches a climax, and all the students are mesmerized as all the lights in the auditorium flash on. On stage, the professor stands in a welcoming pose, a microphone in hand. Nearly all the students are clapping now, and many start to laugh as the professor begins to bow animatedly. The two massive projection screens brightly snap to a clean greeting. This is Allias’ first day of college.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 014] Allias then looks at Alka’s empty seat and notices Alka’s phone. It had fallen off of the armrest and now sits alone, its shattered face barely visible beneath the seat. Without hesitation, Allias grabs the phone and rushes out of the auditorium. Nobody is in the hallways except for Alka and Allias. There are several lectures going on at once, and faint voices echo above the distant squeaking of Alka’s shoes against the floor. Allias catches the very last second of Alka, at the far end of the hallway, running and collapsing in some awkward half flip before plowing through a restroom door. Allias follows Alka.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 015] When Allias enters the restroom, Alka is already in a stall, vomiting into a toilet. The stall door is open, and Alka’s backpack had been dropped near the sinks. Allias stands still for a moment. Allias is familiar with the suspended feeling of being in a completely new place, having no idea where any of the doors lead, uncertain about which way home is, and it holds your breath slightly until the world has comfortably loaded itself into your brain. And, there’s another feeling when you know that you’ll be in this new place for a long time, long enough to develop intense memories. This is the feeling that makes one new place more distinct than other new places. Distinct enough to form the core of some people’s lives, possibly even a recurring setting for their dreams. People don’t notice these feelings until they happen, and sometimes, when they happen, they hit hard. Some people don’t like to talk about these feelings, and most people want to get over these feelings immediately. New places are temporarily discomforting by default. Allias thinks this discomfort is strangely pleasant. Allias approaches Alka with hesitation.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 016] Allias peeks near the open stall door and speaks: “Hi…?” Alka is slightly startled and turns to look at Allias. Then Alka turns back to the toilet and vomits again. Allias: “Are you ok?” Alka laughs into the toilet and groans: “it’s going GREAT.” Alka doesn’t turn back. Alka doesn’t move. Allias waits for a moment before extending Alka’s phone towards the body kneeling over the toilet: “You left this back there.” Alka turns and looks at the phone. Without hesitation, Alka takes the phone and whips it across the room. The phone smashes against a wall and tumbles somewhere. Allias shoots Alka a worried look: “What are you doing?! Why?” Alka leans back, rips out a wad of toilet paper, and scoots backwards on the floor towards a wall: “hey. can you toss my backpack over here?” The toilet flushes itself.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 017] Allias pulls Alka’s backpack towards the wall, closer to Alka. Alka hugs the backpack and manages a small smile: “thanks.” Allias stands there for a moment before asking: “Do you want help? Maybe water?” Alka runs a finger across the grooves between the elegant tiling and then looks up at the chandeliers: “this… is the nicest bathroom that could ever exist. i like it here.” Allias also notices the chandeliers and takes a small step back in silent awe. The ceilings are impressively high for a restroom, and the chandeliers are designed like stairwells going in all directions. Everything is spotless and sparkling. Allias: “Yeah, it’s hard to believe. Everything on this campus is just like this.” Alka: “huh. maybe we’re dreaming. i certainly wish i was.” Allias thinks about this. Alka looks at Allias: “what brought you here?” Allias answers with a modest hint of excitement: “I’m studying computer science.” Alka slaps the tiling: “no, what are you doing here? this bathroom? right now? lecture’s still going, you’re missing out.” Allias takes a small step back: “I was about to- I thought you… well actually…” Alka, still sitting on the floor: “what? who are you?” Allias glances at the elegant frames around the mirrors above the sinks. They don’t quite register in Allias’ mind. Alka is still on the floor, and Allias doesn’t want to abandon Alka like this. There’s something that could be said. Allias carefully asks: “…I think I just want to talk, just for a moment?”
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 018] Alka leans back against the patterned tiling on the wall and looks straight ahead: “hm.” It’s silent for a moment, and Allias decides to stay and wait. Alka takes a breath before speaking: “i can’t get any of it out of my head.” Allias sits on the floor: “What is it?” Alka continues to look straight ahead, delivering nonchalantly: “the way my dog died. it’s still vivid in my mind.” Allias: “Oh…” Alka’s tone changes: “but that’s not what’s throwing me off right now. it hurts still, but, i’ve been trying to call my parents, ever since they dropped me off. they’re not responding. and that’s not normal. my parents aren’t like that. i love my parents, they’re good people. but our home… they live in the middle of nowhere. maybe they… i don’t know. they dropped me off here a week ago.”
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 019] A full body’s length of empty air sits between them. Allias wonders if Alka had spent most of the week like this. Allias wonders what more had happened the week prior. Allias wonders what might take Alka’s mind off of this. Allias wonders what the dog’s name was. Allias doesn’t know what to say. Allias wonders why people don’t always find the right words, which is strange when there are seemingly infinite ways of putting words together. Allias also wonders why people sometimes expect words to be said regardless of how effective they are. Sometimes most of the difficulty comes not with which words to use but rather in how the words will be received, be it in empty promises, muddy reassurance, or a relatable story. Especially when little is known, words can fall anywhere between destructive and healing, regardless of the initial intent.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 020] And then, suddenly, from the other end of the fancy restroom, Alka’s phone begins to ring, and the ringtone is loud. It’s also pretty groovy. It’s from a part of a song that Allias has never heard before. It plays for a short moment before Alka eventually rises from the floor and walks to the phone, and the sound of rubber soles slightly slashing against the tile bounces off the walls, clashing against the ringtone. Allias starts to stand up, watching from a short distance. Alka picks up the shattered phone and answers it on its last ring, glancing once at Allias: “…hello? …ma? hi… yeah. no, i didn’t… no, i’m ok. yeah… ok, yeah. ok, ok. bye.” Alka puts away the phone.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 021] It’s quiet for a moment before Allias asks: “Was that-” Alka interrupts Allias: “what’s your name?” Allias is thrown off: “What?” Alka is looking at Allias: “what’s your name.” Allias takes a second: “…Allias (AH-lee-is).” Alka starts to walk off: “alright. i’m alka (AHL-ka). i’m going now.” Alka’s sudden change of mood surprises Allias. Allias reflects over the idea of Alka simply walking off, as if nothing had happened. As if Alka hadn’t just vomited. Allias: “Where are you going? Alka?” Alka glances at the massive clock cabinet in the corner of the restroom: “anywhere. maybe food.” Allias also turns to look at the massive clock cabinet in the corner of the restroom: “But class isn’t over yet…?” They both briefly admire the expensive clock. There are 40 minutes left in class. Alka: “it’s up to you, allias. are you hungry?” As Alka walks towards the door, Allias calls after Alka: “Wait.”
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 022] Alka wakes up. Something metal whirls and retracts away from Alka’s face, and little lights are blinking everywhere around Alka. For a moment, Alka lays there, on the comfortable bed, staring blankly. Alka is completely surrounded by machinery, and it is overwhelmingly unfamiliar. The tension in Alka’s head grows quickly until Alka freaks out and throws a punch at the monster. Everything starts to move at once, and the monster’s cables and metal arms instantly retract from Alka. Alka rolls and tumbles out of the bed and crashes onto the floor, and a sudden, searing pain fills Alka’s stomach. Alka looks down. There is a massive bandage over Alka’s entire midsection.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 023] The observatory. Groaning, Alka leans back and grabs the edge of the bed, looking around. The early morning sunlight peeks through the equipment, but the holiday lights are still on. Some of the lights dangle from the observatory ceiling, and some of the lights drop down to the floor around Alka and wrap neatly around dozens and dozens of potted plants. Nearly all the plants are flowering. Half of the flowers are colorful geraniums, and all of the flowers are blooming wildly. Alka pushes away from the bed, looking around before hurrying in a confused stumble out of the monster, following the vague rays of the sunrise.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 024] Alka eventually starts to run, bumping into metal sections of the monster and stumbling over the potted flowers. Then Alka sees Allias. Allias is sitting at a small dining table in the kitchen, already waiting for Alka. Alka stops and stands at a distance, eyes locked in terrified confusion at Allias. And then, before Allias has a chance to explain, Alka launches into a sprint and tackles Allias. Allias blindly throws both hands forward in fear: “Wait! AaaAAA-” The two of them slam into the kitchen table, brutally demolishing it, and Alka recovers in a chaotic flip. Allias yelps and crashes against the kitchen stove, and the pot of soup shakes a little.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 025] Alka stumbles a little before launching again at Allias: “take me BACK!” Allias, on the floor, throws both hands in the air: “What?! Help! I helped!” Alka blindly trips over a piece of the shattered kitchen table and violently falls face-flat, further shattering what remains of the table. Allias scoots away from the loud mess, hands still up: “I sent a message, to the Space Mail Service! They’re sending a ship!” Alka rolls over on the floor in pain, gripping the bandages around Alka’s midsection. The bandages have gone a little red. Alka, still clearly confused, manages to sit up on the floor: “…what?” Allias remains on the floor at a distance: “Do you remember? You crashed your spaceship, in the ocean. I tried to rescue you…” Alka immediately stands and scans the observatory for an exit, stumbling: “my SHIP!”
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 026] Alka spots the observatory door and sprints again. Allias watches: “Do you know where you’re going?!” Alka shoves the door open and looks outside: “my ship! in the OCEAN.” Alka runs out of the observatory. Allias: “There’s no way-” The observatory door clicks shut. Allias sits alone in the observatory.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 027] Alka runs across the sand and stops before the shoreline. The ocean is quiet and calm, and there’s a soft mist in the air. The silent sunrise fills this mist. Alka leans over and touches the ocean. It’s freezing. Alka looks with fixed intent at some random point in the distance. Alka then takes a few steps back, runs, and leaps as far as humanly possible into the ocean. The beach is very short, and the sand stops immediately before a submerged ledge, a sharp drop into cold, total darkness. Alka stares with wide eyes into the deep nothingness. Finding the spaceship now would be impossible. Alka then resurfaces, splashing in the ocean, gasping, and screams.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 028] It’s not long before Alka is back on shore, running along the perimeter of the island, shivering, eyes following the shoreline. The sun is a little higher now, and the mist is starting to clear. Alka continues to run. Alka usually finds it difficult to understand why many people are happy to stay in one place for most of their lives. When the span of the world seems infinite, it’s confusing to see that only few aimlessly wander. When people come across a tiny part of the world that feels comforting, many find it hard to believe that there could be millions of places out there that come close to or even exceed that level of comfort. From the world outside their bedroom to the world outside all boundaries, the entirety of the world outside their own is summarized into the limited glimpse of what they’ve seen and know. But most people don’t have a choice. Alka continues to run, shivering. After many moments like this in Alka’s life, Alka wonders: maybe they’re correct. In the deep, infinite ocean there are many beautiful gems, but the ocean is so deep and infinite that the gems might as well not exist. Several hours in the ocean can do anything to a person. Alka continues to run, not exactly knowing why.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 029] It is easier to cross a physical distance than a mental one. They are both distances that every person crosses for the entirety of life, and every person has different ways of crossing them. Rarely do the distances reach the same destination. Many people are happy in the world of their minds, whether they honestly like it or not, and some find fulfillment in sharing theirs with others. But when minds become conflicted, many people tend to find the first opportunity to cross a physical distance, avoiding the mental bridge, because the pain in the destruction of all the thoughts and memories that define you is greater than that of which any physical torment can achieve. Sometimes some people unwillingly go through the effort of pushing everyone away and then cry for themselves, despite being merely a few minutes away from the next nearest person. There is no meaningful correlation between physical and mental distance. Some people don’t even understand themselves, and some people don’t realize that they don’t understand themselves. And then there are those who simply could care less about the holes in their world and don’t mind the sinking. It’s just a destination, and all the people together create a beautiful map.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 030] At the end of the day, Alka had completed a loop around the entire island. Alka had found nothing but sand, ocean, grass, and rock. The island is almost entirely flat. Alka now walks slowly, eyes tiredly pointed towards the observatory. Allias is sitting in the sand just outside the observatory, watching the sunset.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 031] Alka approaches Allias. The color of the sunset is warm. Alka’s voice carries above the water hugging the shoreline: “is this all this planet is? this island, that building… and that miserable ocean?” Allias continues to watch the sunset: “Sit down.” Alka glances around: “are you really alone here? you don’t have any way off of this planet?” Allias continues to watch the sunset: “Hey, sit down, right here.” Allias pats the sand. After a moment, Alka sits down. Allias seems more tired than Alka. Allias continues to watch the sunset: “What do you remember? Do you remember anything?” Alka then looks at the observatory and points at it: “how long was i in there?” Allias: “Only two nights. What do you remember?”
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 032] Alka looks at the sunset. Alka takes a breath before speaking: “i was delivering packages. then my ship ran out of fuel. this was the longest delivery i’ve ever done… there would’ve been a big paycheck.” Allias: “What were you delivering?” Alka: “i just deliver the packages. it’s not my business to know what’s inside them.” Allias continues to watch the sunset: “How many packages?” Alka: “i don’t know, too many. i didn’t count them. by the time i got here, there was only one left. it hurts to keep track of the time when flying between the stars.” Allias is reminded of the chilling void that makes up most of outer space: “Why send human pilots with the mail ships? Can’t the ships fly themselves?” Alka almost jokingly recites: “we provide a personal, unparalleled experience with our delivery. well, at least we’re supposed to.” The water hugging the shoreline is nearly as calm as the sun. Allias: “Do you remember anything else?” Alka answers collectedly: “that’s all that happened.” Allias: “Not even dreams?” Alka looks hollowly at Allias: “is this a joke?” Allias continues to watch the sunset. Alka sighs: “i haven’t dreamt in years.”
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 033] They both watch the sunset quietly for a moment. As the sun starts to dip lower into the ocean, Allias seems more relaxed and starts to stand up: “I can’t believe you spent the entire day running around this island… you haven’t eaten anything all day. Are you hungry?” Alka doesn’t get up: “when will my people arrive?” Allias: “What?” Alka: “this morning, you said you sent a message.” Allias: “Oh, the Space Mail Service. I’ll show you the transcript. I’m not sure when they’ll arrive.” Allias starts to walk towards the observatory. Alka continues to watch the sunset. Allias then stops and looks back: “Are you alright?”
        </p> <p class="anim">[Island of Mind 034] Alka vaguely points at the observatory: “that awful mess inside that building… what is it?” Allias speaks thoughtfully: “That project… it took centuries, and countless people worked on it. It’s completed now. But it’s easier to experience it in person than to describe it.” When Alka doesn’t respond, Allias starts to walk towards the observatory again, this time not stopping when Alka doesn’t follow. Allias is not sure what Alka is thinking. Allias calls back to Alka: “You can stay out here if you want… it’s safe everywhere on the planet.” Alka, still sitting on the sand, calls after Allias: “hey, what’s your name?” Allias, at a distance, stops walking: “Allias. And yours?” Alka: “alka.” Alka seems to be staring at the darkening sky as if it were an empty wall: “it’s beautiful out here, allias.” There is a very subtle warmth that briefly lingers in the sand at the end of the day. Allias walks back to the observatory, and Alka sits on the sand until the warmth fades away.

        <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 001] As the sun sets, a soft sheet of golden sunlight settles across a peaceful island. An ocean softly curls around this island, around and around, slowly circling across the entire planet. Resting on one shore of this island is one solitary building, the only building on this planet. It is an observatory, and for years this has been the home of just one person. However, at the moment, there are two people on this planet. Allias drags Alka through the observatory door, both of them dripping wet. A burnt and torn uniform clings to Alka’s limp body. The door clicks shut behind them. The sunset peeks through the observatory windows and casts shadows of Allias and Alka across the equipment in the observatory, sending flickers of golden gray across the metal, and the light rays fill the droplets flung from their soaked clothing. The shadows all fall when Allias slips, and Allias and Alka slam into the floor. The thud echoes within the observatory. Allias, shivering, pushes up against the floor and looks back in dread at Alka’s silent body. There’s nobody else to ask for help. Allias rises and continues to drag Alka, ignoring the feeling of faint, ignoring the red streak on the floor behind Alka, ignoring how neither of them know each other, and ignoring the pot of soup that has been gently boiling in the observatory’s kitchen since today’s sunrise.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 002] Allias drags Alka into the heart of the observatory, where a monstrous bulk of metal rises to the domed ceiling. The sun has now completely set, and many sets of holiday lights carefully draped across the equipment have flickered on, synchronized to a small timer Allias had set several years ago. The little lights make all the metal panels shine in several subtle colors. It isn’t long before Allias is sitting at the edge of this bulk of metal, scanning a dimmed computer screen. Allias can’t tell if Alka will survive. Alka is now out of sight, resting on an extremely comfortable bed, several meters away from Allias. This bed, the centerpiece of the observatory, lies directly beneath the bulk of metal, and an elegant monstrosity of cables and metal arms envelopes the bed in a jungle of technology so complex anyone could stare at it forever and still notice something new. This used to bother Allias, but after several years of work, Allias had found that this metal monster was already in its simplest, most minimal state, and Allias had to insist, for Allias’ own sanity, that no, this is not the work of an evil scientist, alien species, or top dollar sci-fi film studio, and yes, every piece has a meaningful, refined purpose. But this isn’t a typical observatory.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 003] This elegant metal monster wasn’t designed to bring people back to life. While one of its certain purposes is to keep people alive, its true purpose is far more intimate. At the moment, all Allias can do is wait. The monster makes a soothing, whirling noise in the background as it computes. Allias absently watches a little logo animate on the monster’s computer screen. Allias had already noticed the logo printed on the breast of Alka’s uniform: now scorched, but in happy, bold letters, the initials of the Space Mail Service. Allias was not expecting a delivery. Whatever the delivery was, it is now tucked within what remains of a derpy little spaceship, now lost to the depths of this planet’s ocean.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 004] Earlier, when the spaceship crashed, the wreck stayed afloat long enough for Allias to swim out and rescue Alka. Alka had been severely injured upon impact. Alka had also passed out, and Allias was surprised to find Alka mostly intact. Had Allias not been there, Alka would have drifted down to the bottom of the ocean. It was eerily calm right after Allias began to swim back to shore. Allias was barely managing to tow the limp Alka, but this rescue quickly became ridiculously difficult when Alka suddenly woke, took one look at Allias, and panicked: “…what is THIS?!” They both began to sink as Alka flailed: “this isn’t…” Alka sharply inhaled in pain and then gasped for air as Allias tried to get Alka to calm down. Alka shoved Allias: “NO!!” Alka then faded out and sank, and Allias dove after Alka.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 005] When Allias and Alka resurfaced, Alka continued to flail as Allias tried to press Alka towards shore. Alka pushed away again: “let me GO!” Allias struggled to keep Alka’s head above the water as Alka grew heavy in pain. Alka began to fade once again, gasping: “it’s cold…” This pain was crisp in Alka’s voice: “it’s so cold…” Alka seemed to be speaking to the clouds above: “where’s my-” Alka flailed again, smacking Allias in the face as Alka panicked: “my SHIP?!” It had taken Allias a very long time to rescue Alka. Allias had never been in the water for this long. The ocean is always cold and thoroughly empty. Alka had passed out again right before they got to the shore. And now, still shivering, Allias waits by the metal monster, strangely wanting more than anything for Alka to wake and say anything again. Allias thinks about how it’s strange to feel more lonely with a silent someone than with no one.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 006] Allias leans away from the screen and stands up, tired and lost in a new thought. Hungry for a distraction, Allias heads towards the observatory kitchen. The soup from this morning is still gently boiling, and Allias ladles some of it into a bowl, noticing the little bubbles, face just above the steam. The steam is warm, and it leaves a faint mark on a nearby window. Allias looks at the night sky outside the observatory. The soup’s warmth is soft and soothing. Allias sighs. All that had happened earlier stands pale when compared to the rest of Allias’ life. But Allias had never been through something like this. This circumstance is certainly unique and compelling for Allias. Staring at the night sky, Allias ponders delicately over a difficult decision. After a thoughtful moment, Allias is sitting again next to the metal monster, fighting off the growing weight of sleep.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 007] It’s difficult to convey beauty in the passage of time when there is little to expect. It’s easy to fill a dull moment with aimless fidgeting or wandering thoughts. It’s hard to say nothing happened and just leave it at that, a blank page. Allias refuses to admit that life is often a blank page. There is a genuine truth in nothingness that people want to challenge. Nearly all people take this challenge, and the result of all this together creates something catastrophically beautiful.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 008] This silent waiting is taking a toll on Allias. It’s already tomorrow.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 009] This is the best place to start. This moment, when Allias decides to fully engage the monster, typing on the keyboard, staring at the dimmed screen, with Alka resting on the extremely comfortable bed beneath the dizzying bulk of observatory equipment, and this bulk, this monster, suddenly roaring to life at Allias’ command, but not in a machine-like way, rather more like an orchestral hum, the largest orchestra to ever exist, with every instrument tuning, but to different notes, and some of the instruments are people, a sizable choir, and one of the instruments seems to be playing its own melody, and then the holiday lights scattered throughout the observatory start to dim and flicker as the monster draws in more energy, and soon the noise collects itself and collapses into something pleasant, like the theme of a stream at the toes of several mountains, spinning around the roots of aged trees, and it starts to get dark, very dark, but pleasantly dark, like the dark of the excitement before a premiere of a film you’ve been forever wanting to see, or what the night sky feels like when you’re watching it with someone you love. As the theme continues, Allias leaves the screen and walks towards the bed where Alka rests. Allias lays on the bed next to Alka, both of them now beneath the monster, and Allias’ eyes close. This is the story of Allias’ decision.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 010] An auditorium. Almost every seat is taken by the time Allias arrives. Allias knows a few of the students sitting in this class, but the connection is only vague: a small, fleeting set of smiling faces that once wandered through the hallways of Allias’ memory. But Allias can’t see any of them right now. There are hundreds of students in this auditorium. And the lights are dimmed for some reason, as if a few movie trailers were about to play on the two massive projection screens at the front. Allias takes one of the few remaining seats in the back of the auditorium.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 011] The back of the auditorium. The door behind Allias swings open and slams against the wall, causing the students sitting nearby to jump a little, and some of them turn around. And then, when another student like them enters, they immediately relax and turn away. Alka is one of the last people to arrive for class. There is an open seat next to Allias, and Alka quickly takes it. Alka is in a little bit of a mess: disheveled clothing, wide eyes, and a backpack clutched aggressively in one hand. Allias doesn’t stare at Alka and only notices Alka’s phone. It’s an old model, and its screen is shattered. Alka places the phone on the armrest between the two of them.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 012] They don’t say anything to each other. The scene is new to both of them, and it’s taking them both a few tries to make sense of everything: numerous heads of varying hairstyles, new voices buried between unfamiliar words, that one lost student still searching for a seat, and a few people a few rows ahead furiously scrolling through maps on different devices. Nobody really knows anybody. The visible, eager, energetic fear seems to be shared by everyone at once. And then the auditorium goes dark. All the students immediately shut up as a dramatic, low, musical tone rolls across the darkness, and a voice rises and echoes above the noise. This noise crashes against all the walls in the auditorium, but the voice is warm and surprisingly energetic. It’s 8:00 AM.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 013] Then Alka slaps the armrest and keels over in pain. Allias, the only person nearby who can barely hear Alka above the introduction, looks worriedly at Alka but doesn’t have time to speak before Alka suddenly stands, still clutching the backpack, and nearly falls. Alka then hurries in the darkness towards the back door, nearly crashing into a wall. Alka quietly slips out of the auditorium. Allias looks around. Nobody else seems to have noticed. Allias is immediately distracted by the voice as it suddenly bursts with enthusiasm, building an avalanche of words, capturing many of the thoughts stirring in all the students’ heads, speaking of the future, of challenges, of career, of adventure, of love, speaking until the musical number reaches a climax, and all the students are mesmerized as all the lights in the auditorium flash on. On stage, the professor stands in a welcoming pose, a microphone in hand. Nearly all the students are clapping now, and many start to laugh as the professor begins to bow animatedly. The two massive projection screens brightly snap to a clean greeting. This is Allias’ first day of college.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 014] Allias then looks at Alka’s empty seat and notices Alka’s phone. It had fallen off of the armrest and now sits alone, its shattered face barely visible beneath the seat. Without hesitation, Allias grabs the phone and rushes out of the auditorium. Nobody is in the hallways except for Alka and Allias. There are several lectures going on at once, and faint voices echo above the distant squeaking of Alka’s shoes against the floor. Allias catches the very last second of Alka, at the far end of the hallway, running and collapsing in some awkward half flip before plowing through a restroom door. Allias follows Alka.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 015] When Allias enters the restroom, Alka is already in a stall, vomiting into a toilet. The stall door is open, and Alka’s backpack had been thrown near the sinks. There is another student in the restroom, also standing near the sinks, also clearly surprised by Alka’s presence. But before Allias can ask, the student shrugs and walks out of the restroom. Allias grips Alka’s phone and walks closer. Alka is kneeling in front of the toilet, head up in visible pain. Allias knocks on the open stall door: “Hi…?” Alka is slightly startled and turns to look at Allias. After a good look, Alka turns back to the toilet and vomits again. Allias: “Are you ok?” Alka laughs into the toilet and groans: “it’s going GREAT.” Allias had already heard about the various friends who completely changed once they got to campus. Allias is familiar with the suspended feeling of being in a completely new place, having no idea where any of the doors lead, uncertain about which way home is, and it holds your breath slightly until the world has comfortably loaded itself into your brain. And, there’s another feeling when you know that you’ll be in this new place for a long time, long enough to develop intense memories. This is the feeling that makes one new place more distinct than other new places. Distinct enough to form the core of some people’s lives, possibly even a recurring setting for their dreams. People don’t notice these feelings until they happen, and sometimes, when they happen, they hit hard. Some people don’t like to talk about these feelings, and most people want to get over these feelings immediately. New places are temporarily discomforting by default. Allias thinks this discomfort is strangely pleasant.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 016] Allias waits for a moment before extending Alka’s phone towards the body kneeling over the toilet: “You left this back there.” Alka turns and looks at the phone. Without hesitation, Alka takes the phone and whips it across the room. The phone smashes against a wall and tumbles somewhere. Allias shoots Alka a worried look: “What are you doing?! Why?” Alka leans back, rips out a wad of toilet paper, and scoots backwards on the floor, out of the stall, towards the nearest wall: “hey. can you toss my backpack over here?” The toilet flushes itself.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 017] Allias pulls Alka’s backpack towards the wall, closer to Alka. Alka hugs the backpack and manages a small smile: “thanks.” Allias stands there for a moment before asking: “Do you want help? Maybe water?” Alka runs a finger across the grooves between the elegant tiling and then looks up at the chandeliers: “this… is the nicest bathroom that could ever exist. i like it here.” Allias also notices the chandeliers and takes a small step back in silent awe. The ceilings are impressively high for a restroom, and the chandeliers are designed like stairwells going in all directions. Everything is spotless and sparkling. Allias: “Yeah, it’s hard to believe. Everything on this campus is just like this.” Alka: “huh. maybe we’re dreaming. i certainly wish i was.” Allias thinks about this. Alka looks at Allias: “what brought you here?” Allias answers with a modest hint of excitement: “I’m studying computer science.” Alka slaps the tiling: “no, what are you doing here? this bathroom? right now? lecture’s still going, you’re missing out.” Allias takes a small step back: “I was about to- I thought you… well actually…” Alka, still sitting on the floor: “what? who are you?” Allias glances at the elegant frames around the mirrors above the sinks. They don’t quite register in Allias’ mind. Alka is still on the floor, and Allias doesn’t want to abandon Alka like this. There’s something that could be said. Allias carefully asks: “…I think I just want to talk, just for a moment?”
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 018] Alka leans back against the patterned tiling on the wall and looks straight ahead: “hm.” It’s silent for a moment, and Allias decides to stay and wait. Alka takes a breath before speaking: “i’m tired. i don’t know you.” Allias sits on the floor: “You don’t have to say anything.” Alka continues to look straight ahead, delivering nonchalantly: “when my dog died. i was there, it was vivid.” Allias: “Oh…” Alka’s tone changes: “that was many, many years ago. i don’t know, the memory never left… but lately i’ve been trying to call my parents, ever since they dropped me off. they’re not responding. and that’s not normal. my parents aren’t like that. i love my parents, they’re good people. but our home… they live in the middle of nowhere. maybe they… i don’t know. i can’t get the picture out of my head. they dropped me off here a week ago.”
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 019] A full body’s length of empty air sits between them. Allias wonders if Alka had spent most of the week like this. Allias wonders what more had happened the week prior. Allias wonders what might take Alka’s mind off of this. Allias wonders what the dog’s name was. Allias doesn’t know what to say. Allias wonders why people don’t always find the right words, which is strange when there are seemingly infinite ways of putting words together. Allias also wonders why people sometimes expect words to be said regardless of how effective they are. Sometimes most of the difficulty comes not with which words to use but rather in how the words will be received, be it in empty promises, muddy reassurance, or a relatable story. Especially when little is known, words can fall anywhere between destructive and healing, regardless of the initial intent.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 020] And then, suddenly, from the other end of the fancy restroom, Alka’s phone begins to ring, and the ringtone is loud. It’s also pretty groovy. It’s from a part of a song that Allias has never heard before. Alka doesn’t immediately respond at all. Allias looks at the phone: “Are you going to…?” Alka quickly rises from the floor and walks to the ringing phone. The sound of rubber soles slightly slashing against the tile bounces off the walls, clashing against the ringtone. Allias starts to stand up, watching from a short distance. Alka picks up the shattered phone and silences it. Alka puts away the phone.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 021] It’s quiet for a moment before Allias asks: “Who was-” Alka interrupts Allias: “what’s your name?” Allias is thrown off: “What?” Alka is looking at Allias: “what’s your name.” Allias takes a second: “…Allias (AH-lee-is).” Alka starts to walk off: “alright. i’m alka (AHL-ka). i’m going now.” Alka’s sudden change of mood surprises Allias. Allias reflects over the idea of Alka simply walking off, as if nothing had happened. As if Alka hadn’t just vomited. Allias: “Where are you going? Alka?” Alka glances at the massive clock cabinet in the corner of the restroom: “anywhere. maybe food.” Allias also turns to look at the massive clock cabinet in the corner of the restroom: “But class isn’t over yet…?” They both briefly admire the expensive clock. There are 40 minutes left in class. Alka: “it’s up to you, allias. are you hungry?” As Alka walks towards the door, Allias calls after Alka: “Wait.”
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 022] Alka wakes up. Something metal whirls and retracts away from Alka’s face, and little lights are blinking everywhere around Alka. For a moment, Alka lays there, on the comfortable bed, staring blankly. Alka is completely surrounded by machinery, and it is overwhelmingly unfamiliar. The tension in Alka’s head grows quickly until Alka freaks out and throws a punch at the monster. Everything starts to move at once, and the monster’s cables and metal arms instantly retract from Alka. Alka rolls and tumbles out of the bed and crashes onto the floor, and a sudden, searing pain fills Alka’s stomach. Alka looks down. There is a massive bandage over Alka’s entire midsection.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 023] The observatory. Groaning, Alka leans back and grabs the edge of the bed, looking around. The early morning sunlight peeks through the equipment, but the holiday lights are still on. Some of the lights dangle from the observatory ceiling, and some of the lights drop down to the floor around Alka and wrap neatly around dozens and dozens of potted plants. Nearly all the plants are flowering. Half of the flowers are colorful geraniums, and all of the flowers are blooming wildly. Alka pushes away from the bed, looking around before hurrying in a confused stumble out of the monster, following the vague rays of the sunrise.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 024] Alka eventually starts to run, bumping into metal sections of the monster and stumbling over the potted flowers. Then Alka sees Allias. Allias is sitting at a small dining table in the kitchen, already waiting for Alka. Alka stops and stands at a distance, eyes locked in terrified confusion at Allias. And then, before Allias has a chance to explain, Alka launches into a sprint and tackles Allias. Allias blindly throws both hands forward in fear: “Wait! AaaAAA-” The two of them slam into the kitchen table, brutally demolishing it, and Alka recovers in a chaotic flip. Allias yelps and crashes against the kitchen stove, and the pot of soup shakes a little.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 025] Alka stumbles a little before launching again at Allias: “take me BACK!” Allias, on the floor, throws both hands in the air: “What?! Help! I helped!” Alka blindly trips over a piece of the shattered kitchen table and violently falls face-flat, further shattering what remains of the table. Allias scoots away from the loud mess, hands still up: “I sent a message, to the Space Mail Service! They’re sending a ship!” Alka rolls over on the floor in pain, gripping the bandages around Alka’s midsection. The bandages have gone a little red. Alka, still clearly confused, manages to sit up on the floor: “…what?” Allias remains on the floor at a distance: “Do you remember? You crashed your spaceship, in the ocean. I tried to rescue you…” Alka immediately stands and scans the observatory for an exit, stumbling: “my SHIP!”
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 026] Alka spots the observatory door and sprints again. Allias watches: “Do you know where you’re going?!” Alka shoves the door open and looks outside: “my ship! in the OCEAN.” Alka runs out of the observatory. Allias: “There’s no way-” The observatory door clicks shut. Allias sits alone in the observatory.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 027] Alka runs across the sand and stops before the shoreline. The ocean is quiet and calm, and there’s a soft mist in the air. The silent sunrise fills this mist. Alka leans over and touches the ocean. It’s freezing. Alka looks with fixed intent at some random point in the distance. Alka then takes a few steps back, runs, and leaps as far as humanly possible into the ocean. The beach is very short, and the sand stops immediately before a submerged ledge, a sharp drop into cold, total darkness. Alka stares with wide eyes into the deep nothingness. Finding the spaceship now would be impossible. Alka then resurfaces, splashing in the ocean, gasping, and screams.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 028] It’s not long before Alka is back on shore, running along the perimeter of the island, shivering, eyes following the shoreline. The sun is a little higher now, and the mist is starting to clear. Alka continues to run. Alka usually finds it difficult to understand why many people are happy to stay in one place for most of their lives. When the span of the world seems infinite, it’s confusing to see that only few aimlessly wander. When people come across a tiny part of the world that feels comforting, many find it hard to believe that there could be millions of places out there that come close to or even exceed that level of comfort. From the world outside their bedroom to the world outside all boundaries, the entirety of the world outside their own is summarized into the limited glimpse of what they’ve seen and know. But most people don’t have a choice. Alka continues to run, shivering. After many moments like this in Alka’s life, Alka wonders: maybe they’re correct. In the deep, infinite ocean there are many beautiful gems, but the ocean is so deep and infinite that the gems might as well not exist. Several hours in the ocean can do anything to a person. Alka continues to run, not exactly knowing why.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 029] It is easier to cross a physical distance than a mental one. They are both distances that every person crosses for the entirety of life, and every person has different ways of crossing them. Rarely do the distances reach the same destination. Many people are happy in the world of their minds, whether they honestly like it or not, and some find fulfillment in sharing theirs with others. But when minds become conflicted, many people tend to find the first opportunity to cross a physical distance, avoiding the mental bridge, because the pain in the hostile tampering or destruction of all the thoughts and memories that define you likely rivals that of which the greatest physical torment achieves. Sometimes some people unwillingly go through the effort of pushing everyone away and then cry for themselves, despite being merely a few minutes away from the next nearest person. There is no meaningful correlation between physical and mental distance. Some people don’t even understand themselves, and some people don’t realize that they don’t understand themselves. And then there are those who simply could care less about the holes in their world and don’t mind the sinking. It’s just a destination, and all the people together create a beautiful map.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 030] At the end of the day, Alka had completed a loop around the entire island. Alka had found nothing but sand, ocean, grass, and rock. The island is almost entirely flat. Alka now walks slowly, eyes tiredly pointed towards the observatory. Allias is sitting in the sand just outside the observatory, watching the sunset.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 031] Alka approaches Allias. The color of the sunset is warm. Alka’s voice carries above the water hugging the shoreline: “is this all this planet is? this island, that building… and that miserable ocean?” Allias continues to watch the sunset: “Sit down.” Alka glances around: “are you really alone here? you don’t have any way off of this planet?” Allias continues to watch the sunset: “Hey, sit down, right here.” Allias pats the sand. After a moment, Alka sits down. Allias seems more tired than Alka. Allias continues to watch the sunset: “What do you remember? Do you remember anything?” Alka then looks at the observatory and points at it: “how long was i in there?” Allias: “Only two nights. What do you remember?”
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 032] Alka looks at the sunset. Alka takes a breath before speaking: “i was delivering packages. then my ship ran out of fuel. this was the longest delivery i’ve ever done… there would’ve been a big paycheck.” Allias: “What were you delivering?” Alka: “i just deliver the packages. it’s not my business to know what’s inside them.” Allias continues to watch the sunset: “How many packages?” Alka: “i don’t know, too many. i didn’t count them. by the time i got here, there was only one left. i don’t like to keep track of the time between the stars.” Allias is reminded of the chilling void that makes up most of outer space: “So you’re a space pilot? Can’t the space ships fly themselves?” Alka immediately recites, almost jokingly: “we provide a personal, unparalleled experience as a standard for our delivery service.” The water hugging the shoreline is nearly as calm as the sun. Allias: “Do you remember anything else?” Alka answers collectedly: “that’s all that happened.” Allias: “Not even dreams?” Alka looks hollowly at Allias: “is this a joke?” Allias continues to watch the sunset. Alka sighs: “i haven’t dreamt in years.”
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 033] They both watch the sunset quietly for a moment. As the sun starts to dip lower into the ocean, Allias seems more relaxed and starts to stand up: “I can’t believe you spent the entire day running around this island… you haven’t eaten anything all day. Are you hungry?” Alka doesn’t get up: “when will my people arrive?” Allias: “What?” Alka: “this morning, you said you sent a message.” Allias: “Oh, the Space Mail Service. I’ll show you the transcript. I’m not sure when they’ll arrive.” Allias starts to walk towards the observatory. Alka continues to watch the sunset. Allias then stops and looks back: “Are you alright?”
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 034] Alka vaguely points at the observatory: “that awful mess inside that building… what is it?” Allias speaks thoughtfully: “That project… it took centuries, and countless people worked on it. It’s completed now. But it’s easier to experience it in person than to describe it.” When Alka doesn’t respond, Allias starts to walk towards the observatory again, this time not stopping when Alka doesn’t follow. Allias is not sure what Alka is thinking. Allias calls back to Alka: “You can stay out here if you want… it’s safe everywhere on the planet.” Alka, still sitting on the sand, calls after Allias: “hey, what’s your name?” Allias, at a distance, stops walking: “Allias. And yours?” Alka: “alka.” Alka seems to be staring at the darkening sky as if it were an empty wall: “it’s beautiful out here, allias.” There is a very subtle warmth that briefly lingers in the sand at the end of the day. Allias walks back to the observatory, and Alka sits on the sand until the warmth fades away.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 035] The campus lawn. It’s morning, and the sunlight fills the trees and scatters over well-trimmed grass. A quiet breeze occasionally flickers the leaves, and all of the leaves are bright green. There aren’t many students on the campus lawn, since most of them are still in class right now. Alka and Allias are walking to the campus dining hall.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 036] Alka is wearing a pullover hooded sweater. The sweater is a little faded and has no print on it, but it is the softest fabric Alka has ever worn. This sweater belongs to Allias. Allias lent the sweater to Alka right before Alka tried walking out of the restroom with a vomit-stained shirt. Allias had noticed the very unique picture printed on Alka’s shirt, but Allias couldn’t understand what it was. Allias’ sweater and shirt are nearly the same color, while Alka’s shirt does not match the sweater at all. Alka is currently preoccupied with the cuffs of the sweater: “this is too real. i can’t believe they can make clothing this soft. you’re probably not going to get this back.” Allias is squinting at the small panels next to the buildings, trying to find the one labeled for dining: “You can have it. I have three more sweaters exactly like that in my dorm.” There are a lot of geese on the lawn. Alka: “which dorm did you choose?” Allias: “The one by the lake.” Alka: “no way… isn’t that the oldest building on this campus?” Allias looks at the geese: “I don’t know. I just like the lake.” Alka: “don’t you have to walk to another building just to do laundry in that dorm?” Allias wonders what the geese are thinking: “I don’t mind the walk.” Alka is still preoccupied with the cuffs of the sweater: “huh. i’ve really got to check out this lake.”
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 037] The campus dining hall. Alka and Allias enter through two sets of intricately carved wooden double doors. They walk into a grand hallway with intricately carved wooden columns, each rising to the roof of the building. The two furthest columns feature beautiful grand staircases. The building is five floors tall, and each floor features a unique buffet. A summary of the menu is displayed on a large, colorful touch screen in the middle of the hallway. Alka stops to watch the menu gradually animate through a list of showcase dishes, and Allias continues to walk off to the nearest buffet table, eyes locked on a steaming metal cauldron. By the time Alka walks away from the menu screen, Allias is holding a bowl of oatmeal. Allias scans the nearby dining tables: “Where do you want to sit?” Alka notices the bowl in Allias’ hands and furiously points at it: “that’s it? you’ve got a greater immediate selection of food than nearly every person on earth… and you decide on OATMEAL? you better get something else or i’m leaving you here.” Allias looks dejectedly at the bowl of oatmeal.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 038] Allias and Alka agree to walk by every buffet table on all five floors in the dining hall. After touring the fifth floor, they find two seats with a nice view overlooking the campus. The campus is generally surrounded by heavy forest on one side and a prairie on the other. A large lake sits at the edge of the campus, comfortably enveloped within the forest. There is a small city barely visible at the other edge of campus, and a few more towns are clustered even further away. The tallest building in sight is the auditorium that Alka and Allias had just walked from. Allias watches as Alka carefully lowers two crowded plates of food onto the table. The plates are a messy collection of small bits taken from nearly every available dish they walked by. Allias had already finished the bowl of oatmeal during this walk up through the dining hall. Allias now holds a mug of hot chocolate and focuses on the clouds in the horizon.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 039] At the moment, Allias and Alka are the only people on the fifth floor. This dining table that Allias and Alka have chosen feels like an eagle’s nest, tucked within one of the most beautiful places overlooking the campus. It is partially secluded, only because most students avoid the long trip up the grand staircases to the fifth floor. The sunlight is bright and filling, and it quietly warms the faces of Allias and Alka. They both notice this, but neither of them acknowledge it.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 040] They don’t speak until Alka finishes one of the two plates. Alka appears particularly ordinary now, and Allias is still reflecting on the drastic change in Alka’s mood over the past hour. Allias asks: “When’s your next class?” Alka focuses on an omelette while speaking: “i don’t have another lecture until tomorrow. i’ll probably see you there, since it’s for the same class from earlier, in the auditorium.” Allias lifts an empty mug and prepares to leave: “I’ve got one soon. I should probably leave now.” Alka is focused on cutting through the omelette with a fork: “yeah go ahead.” Allias rises from the dining table but decides to ask Alka another question: “Is there anything else bothering you?” Alka laughs and points the fork at the omelette: “i’m bothered that you didn’t get anything else besides oatmeal.” Allias, now standing, places the empty mug on the table in front of Alka: “What about this?” Alka looks away from the omelette and glances at the mug: “that doesn’t count. is that really all you’ll try? you are most definitely missing out.” Allias points at the mug: “I got exactly what I wanted, and I enjoyed it.” Alka: “oatmeal is not a personality.” Allias: “What?” Alka: “what else do you want me to say?” Allias points at Alka’s two plates: “We each know what we want. You knew what you wanted, so that’s what you got, right?” Alka takes a bite of omelette: “no. i don’t have the slightest idea.” Allias: “What?” Alka points the fork at the two plates: “look at this, this here. i couldn’t possibly know what i’d like out of everything if i didn’t know what anything in everything was.” Allias: “…What?”
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 041] Allias notices that first conversations don’t often reveal who people really are. Curiously, given enough effort, it is unfairly simple to describe all the thoughts that amount to one person, but it is rarely the priority to summarize these thoughts as they are. People rather tend to describe themselves in the same way films or video games are promoted, in spirit of trailers or cover art: carefully crafted to make people think a certain way, hiding some key elements, sometimes focusing on relatable or alluring features, sometimes focusing on connections to other famous people or ideas, and sometimes staying completely vague. But there are the rare people who, beginning from the first encounter, will describe themselves thoroughly, disregarding spoilers, unafraid of their immediate vulnerability, and these people tend to be the most precious of the ridiculous. At the same time, Allias thinks there is no meaningful correlation between those who are good at talking and those who are just good people.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 042] Alka stops eating and puts down the fork: “alright. enough about me, what do you want? who are you?” Allias starts to walk off again: “Can you ask me again later? I’ve got to get to class soon.” Alka: “i have no idea who you are.” Allias: “I just don’t-” Alka: “just ONE thing.” Allias stops, sighs, and answers the question: “I want to make video games.” Alka then looks at what remains of the omelette: “ah. so we’re both clueless.” Allias makes a face of curious frustration: “What does that mean?” Alka gestures towards the scenery surrounding both of them, looking at Allias: “the real world’s already enough. if you’re so into escaping, you’re missing out on more meaningful things.” Allias starts to walk away again, now obviously preoccupied with a different thought: “That’s nice, Alka.” Alka watches as Allias walks away, and right before Allias descends down the grand staircases, Alka insists: “you’re a naked mole-rat, allias.” Allias pauses and looks back with a strange face: “I’m a… what?” Alka stabs the omelette: “burying yourself in your own world. i don’t know.” Allias glances past Alka at the clouds in the horizon, laughing in confusion: “Don’t ever call me that again.” Alka laughs and chokes on the omelette as Allias walks away. But Alka doesn’t know that Allias isn’t walking to class. Allias doesn’t have class until tomorrow. Allias is free.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 043] The observatory kitchen. Allias ladles some soup into a large bowl and passes it along with a spoon to Alka. Allias then walks over to the monster and starts to type on its keyboard. Alka, following just behind Allias, inspects the soup before trying a spoonful. Alka has never tasted soup like this before. Alka takes another spoonful. Allias steps back and points at the computer screen: “Here’s your transcript.” Alka approaches the screen and ponders over the recorded conversation between Allias and the Space Mail Service. By the time Alka finishes reading through the transcript, Alka is holding an empty bowl.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 044] Alka steps back and stares at the last line of the transcript: “back home, one of my lifetime friends is getting married. i was hoping i’d get back before the wedding. looks like i’m going to miss it.” Allias taps on the keyboard, closing the transcript. All that now remains on the screen is an animated logo. Allias then looks at Alka: “Did you also want to send a message?” Alka looks around the observatory: “no, the transcript’s fine.” The monster is quietly humming, and the nighttime sky fills all of the windows in the observatory. In the kitchen, what remains of the table now sits in a neatly organized pile of broken pieces. Allias notices Alka absently looking through the observatory: “There isn’t much to do on this planet.” Alka is still holding the empty bowl: “yeah, i figured.” Allias points at the monster: “Most of my time is spent in there. Do you want to see how it works?” Alka looks at the monster.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 045] Alka then glances through the windows at the nighttime sky before facing Allias: “how long will it take?” Allias starts to walk towards the monster: “As long as you want. It’s up to you.” Allias continues walking, and Alka decides to follow, both of them passing between the walls of metal. When they reach the bed beneath the monster, Allias gracefully rolls onto it, leaving a respectful amount of space for Alka. Alka looks at the bed with doubt. Allias, noticing Alka’s expression, assures Alka: “It’s really up to you.” Alka looks at the metal arms and cables above Allias: “can you prove this is safe?” Allias points at the monster: “You’ll be fine, nothing here can hurt you. And I’ll be with you the whole time.” Alka looks carefully at Allias. The expression on Allias’ face is transparently calm, a tired kind of calm, and a hint of relief lingers on the eyes of Allias, and a thought strikes Alka. Alka grips the empty bowl: “you saved my life, right?” Allias: “I would never let anybody die like that.” Alka trusts Allias but silently looks up at the holiday lights dangling from the ceiling, taking a careful moment to appreciate the bright, colorful scene as if it were the last thing Alka was ever going to see. Alka places the empty bowl on the floor next to a nearby potted plant and rolls onto the bed next to Allias. Nothing happens for a moment. Both of them stare at the cables and metal humming inches away, occasionally distracted by the blinking lights. Alka frowns: “now what?” Allias: “Just relax.” The monster starts to roar to life.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 046] Suddenly Alka and Allias are standing in empty space. Alka can’t see the floor that they’re standing on, but they are both weighted to it. Alka looks above, and then Alka looks below. It feels as if there are two skies: a deep black sky high above and a wide white sky down below. Nothing else. Allias watches as Alka starts to walk around: “How are you doing?” Allias’ voice does not echo. Alka looks at Allias with a curious expression: “where are we?” Allias takes a step away from Alka: “Here, try this: imagine a place, maybe recall a memory. It’ll be easier if it’s a strong memory. Preferably a good one.” Alka doesn’t take very long to recall: “i remember my first piano lesson.” Allias lights up a little: “Oh, you play the piano?” Alka: “no, i don’t. i hate it. but that was the time i first met that lifetime friend, the one getting married. when we met, we were both still kids.”
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 047] The empty space flips into a music store. Alka and Allias are both immediately younger and now stand next to various sets of shiny drums. There’s a person sitting behind a short welcoming counter by the front door. The counter is surrounded by various small pedals, plugs, and panels. The person behind the counter isn’t paying much attention to Alka or Allias. The two children stand in the middle of the store, taking in the scene. Young Allias whispers to young Alka: “Whether or not anyone notices me is up to you. But I won’t do anything.” Alka nods. They can both hear pianos playing from somewhere in the back of the store. A busy city can be partially seen past the guitars displayed against the storefront windows. The music store is very, very small, and it seems to be tucked into the middle of the city. Once every few days, the people in the city will usually hear the distant launch of a spacecraft. Alka starts to walk towards the piano rooms in the back of the store.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 048] There are four cheap chairs crammed next to each other in the small hallway outside the piano rooms. There are only three piano rooms, and the lights are on in only two of these rooms. There are small vertical windows in the doors, and it’s clear how there’s barely enough space in each room for the teacher, piano, and student. The doors don’t do a very good job of blocking out the sound. The hallway is filled with the muffled, clashing sound of two children playing different pianos at the same time. Alka walks up to the first chair in the hallway and struggles to get into it. Young Alka is very short. The young version of Alka’s lifetime friend sits in the third chair, and the parent of this friend sits in the fourth. The parent and the child are peering over a spiral notebook, and they’re taking turns, drawing on it with a plump crayon.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 049] Memories change as the brain ages. This even applies to the fondest, strongest memories. Alka has not yet realized this. It is just the nature of the brain, each time the memory is replayed. Sometimes the memories only shift slightly, quietly changing the color of the sky or the way that one person said that phrase. Sometimes the memories fade so much that the only remnant is a vague feeling of a place that once was. And sometimes the memory rises from an event that didn’t even occur at all. The brain serves one person, and one person only. It will do whatever it takes to serve this person, no matter if this person agrees with the brain or not. Alka is experiencing the memory right now as if it were happening once again, exactly as it was, and it’s somehow loaded with more detail than Alka could possibly remember. This thought hasn’t occurred to Alka yet.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 050] The parent notices Alka sitting alone, watching the notebook, and when the child tries to pass the crayon to the parent, the parent takes the crayon and extends it to Alka. The child is slightly surprised and looks at Alka. Alka takes the crayon and grips it, staring at the crayon for a moment. The parent: “Is this your first time here?” Alka nods. The parent: “What’s your name?” Alka: “alka.” The parent tells the child to pass the notebook to Alka. Alka looks at the drawing.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 051] The drawing is literally just scribbles.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 052] Alka makes a strange face at the drawing: “this is useless!” This makes the child furious: “No it’s not! It’s going to make me forget about DEATH!” The parent immediately panics a little and hushes the child, looking worriedly at Alka. Alka is staring quietly at the drawing. The parent asks Alka: “Alka, are you excited to learn the piano?” Alka doesn’t respond. Alka continues to stare at the page of scribbles, waiting for it to evoke a different response out of Alka. Alka frowns, still gripping the crayon. The parent: “Alka…?”
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 053] Alka turns to a fresh page in the notebook and starts to run the plump crayon over the paper. All three people sitting in the hallway watch as the color gently lays parts of itself on the page. Time flies as they listen beyond the jarred piano keys to the subtle skimming of the crayon’s leading edge, and none of them are thinking about how the crayon’s lifespan is gradually diminishing. They don’t worry about how the marks on the page will never return to the crayon ever again. They simply watch how Alka holds the crayon against the page, how the crayon seamlessly answers, and how the page gives slightly with every pass. Alka’s drawing is naturally unremarkable. None of the three people can make out what it is that Alka is drawing, but at the moment it isn’t important what the drawing is, and the parent smiles, noticing how the two children are deeply captivated by the whirling color on the notebook. To them, the entire world has briefly been reduced to whatever is happening on this notebook. The parent and child don’t say a word as Alka starts to lose track of time. Alka scribbles away almost blindly now, letting the crayon aimlessly follow the jarred notes spilling out of the piano rooms, quietly clashing with the lines it previously drew, and after a while Alka forgets why Alka is even sitting here.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 054] And then Alka suddenly jumps out of the chair, panicking: “allias?!” Alka whips the notebook and crayon aside, and the notebook slaps the child in the face, startling both the parent and child. The parent stands up, hands extended in a worried panic, trying to settle both Alka and the now crying child. Alka darts away from the parent and crashes into a drum set: “allias?! i want out! HELP-” The space flips, and the monster promptly returns Alka and Allias to the bed. Alka wakes up, staring at the blinking lights and metal again, and the monster’s cables and metal arms retract away. Alka doesn’t say a word. Allias is nearby, also awake, also on the bed: “Are you alright?” Both of them are laying on the bed, motionless, their bodies at peace. Allias turns to Alka and explains quickly: “You will return, without fail, whenever you want to leave. Even if something goes wrong, you will be automatically returned after a time limit of a few days.” Alka is still silent. Allias continues, bleeding with excitement: “And it’s only been a few minutes out here… time does flow differently when inside, but it’s also not infinite, and it’s limited by your brain. This machine does try to make it easier for the brain to handle. But it’s not like all those sci-fi movies. You can’t get lost. And it’s impossible to actually get injured or die. It’s like dreaming, but better.”
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 055] Alka doesn’t respond, still staring at the cables and metal. Allias isn’t sure what Alka is thinking, but Allias is clearly worried about this response. Allias wonders if this was all too much. Allias asks again: “Alka? Are you alright?” Then Alka glances at Allias, turns away, and rolls out of the bed: “…i’m just tired.” Allias also rolls off of the bed and watches as Alka walks towards the observatory door: “Where are you going?” Alka doesn’t respond, and Allias follows Alka. Alka pushes through the door and sits on the sand, facing the ocean. All the stars are visible in the night sky. Allias leans outside of the observatory, holding the door open. When Alka doesn’t move from the sand, Allias decides against calling out and returns into the observatory, letting the door close. Allias stands still for a moment, casting a blank gaze at the floor. Allias feels bad, unsure of what had happened with Alka. Allias decides to leave Alka alone. Outside of the observatory, Alka curls up on the sand, eventually falling asleep. A few moments later, Allias exits the observatory and gently throws a blanket over Alka.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 056] The campus forest. Allias walks along a carefully laid brick path that gently weaves between very old trees. Many lamps are scattered along this brick path, and all of them pop out of the bushes of the forest like stars in a nighttime sky. These lamps are all currently off, giving room for the sun to perform its late morning routine. The forest canopy is not very dense, and the sunlight filters through the bright green leaves like the scent of fresh bread in a bakery. It is pleasantly warm and filling. Allias’ dorm is a long walk from the campus lawn. It’s both the oldest and most isolated building on campus property. Allias can already see the dorm at the end of the brick path. It is a quiet building made from the same brick used in the path, and it rises above the forest floor by only two stories. All of its walls are elegantly curved, vaguely mimicking the outline of a bush. If bricks could grow into a massive plant, it would certainly look like this. The lake gives a shimmering backdrop to Allias’ dorm.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 057] Allias’ dorm. The dorm lobby is small, but a massive window spanning the entirety of one of the lobby’s walls gives a fantastic view of the lake. An old upright piano is pushed up against a brick wall opposite the window. There are a few couches arranged in the middle of the lobby, and the colors of these couches passively complement the brick, but there isn’t much else here. Allias’ dorm room is on the second floor, right next to a small open stairwell. There are ten small rooms on the second floor. Allias’ neighbor’s door is open, and the neighbor waves when Allias passes by.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 058] The neighbor is holding up a bed frame, both arms fully extended, clearly trying to move the frame from one side of the bedroom to the other, and as the neighbor waves at Allias, the bed frame snaps and the whole thing tips over, and Allias rushes to grab the frame before it falls. The neighbor stumbles a little but holds the frame up: “Hi Allias.” Allias: “Hi.” The neighbor: “I’m trying to move my bed.” Allias, still holding the frame, looks into the bedroom: “But why?” At the moment, the neighbor’s room is littered with half-open suitcases overflowing onto the floor in a paused stream of various belongings. It isn’t exactly messy, it’s just paused between two moments in time. There’s an extra shelf that hasn’t been filled yet, and there are already dozens of photos and posters taped to half of the walls. The groups of people in the photos all seem to be the neighbor’s friends. One of the posters is covered in handwritten messages from many different people.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 059] The neighbor steps over a bag and lifts the bed frame slightly: “The door keeps slamming against it. Strange right? Why’d they put the bed here?” Allias looks at the frame: “Alright.” They both grip the frame, and immediately Allias notices how one of the joints is loose. Allias catches it before the frame falls apart, but the mattress slides a little and the whole thing tips over. The bed and frame slam loudly against a wall, and Allias and the neighbor crash against the nearby shelves. Everything then falls, and the frame bounces onto the floor and somehow manages to stay in one piece. The neighbor panics and scans the wall, floor, and furniture for damage. Surprisingly, there isn’t a dent or scratch in sight, and the neighbor sighs in relief. Allias smiles and hides a bruised arm.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 060] Allias makes another attempt to lift the frame again: “I tried, I’m sorry…” The neighbor now notices that a single photo had fallen off of the wall: “Sorry for what? The bed’s perfect here. I can take care of the rest, thanks Allias.” The neighbor tries to re-tape the photo to its original spot. Allias looks at the rest of the photos chaotically organized on the wall: “I’ve never seen this many photos of people at once.” The neighbor presses the tape firmly: “I’ll probably never see them again.” Allias: “What?” The neighbor steps back and walks over a few luggages: “We’ve all gone our different ways. Some of the people in these photos have already completely re-written themselves. If I were to meet them now, they wouldn’t be the people I knew. I’d rather not ruin the memory.” Allias looks curiously at the faces in the photos: “You really don’t want to see them again?” The neighbor shuffles through a bag: “I don’t know, they’re really good memories.” The neighbor doesn’t seem very certain about this, but Allias doesn’t push for more.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 061] Someone knocks on the neighbor’s door: “Hey, you ready? They’ve already started, let’s go!” The neighbor zips up the bag: “Yup, I’ve got it.” The student who knocked on the door looks at Allias: “Who’s this?” The neighbor walks out of the room: “Bye, Allias.” The student looks at Allias: “Allias? Allias, you hear what they’re doing at the lake?” Allias doesn’t know what they’re doing at the lake: “I’m tired, I had a rough day.” The neighbor calls from the stairwell: “Hey! Let’s go!” The student looks at Allias once more before turning back and running after the neighbor: “Goodbye, Allias.”
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 062] Allias leaves, closing the neighbor’s door, and walks directly to Allias’ door. A few voices casually bounce at the other end of the hallway as Allias unlocks the door to Allias’ bedroom. The door opens and bumps into the frame of a neatly made bed. The bed is raised on top of two shelves, one of them filled with several items of clothing that match each other in color. The desk fits neatly below a square window. Next to the desk, placed on the floor in the corner where some of the light falls, are three potted plants. All of them are flowers. Allias glances at the flowers before approaching the desk. There aren’t any luggages or photos in sight. The view of the lake is just as good as the view from the dorm’s lobby. Allias sits at the desk, head on the table, and sighs.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 063] The campus lawn. It’s afternoon. There are many students on the lawn now, and most of them sit in small groups where the grass isn’t covered by the canopy of leaves. The geese have already scattered away from the crowd. Some of the students are sitting against the trees, and from a distance it looks as if these trees are wearing shoes, and the shoes are all colorful and talking to each other, toes tapping up and down, but these trees will never go anywhere. Alka is casually walking between these trees, not exactly having a destination in mind.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 064] A hilariously small building at one edge of the lawn catches Alka’s eye, and Alka’s wandering walk immediately snaps directly towards this building’s doors. There seems to be a lot of other students also walking towards this building. The building looks like a small house, but its doors fill the entirety of one of its walls. The doors are made of glass, and they lead to a wide descending flight of stairs. At the moment the doors are all propped open. There are many students going up and down these stairs, some of them walking in groups of five or more, but the stairs are wide enough to fit groups of twenty if they all walked in a single row. There isn’t anything else inside this building. This is the main entrance to the campus underground library.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 065] The campus underground library. A spectacular sight unfolds as Alka descends the flight of stairs, and for a moment Alka stops on the stairs to take the scene in. A small collection of fresh students have also stopped along the stairs, similarly surprised at how much exists beneath the campus, and the many older students weaving through the traffic either briefly reminisce or yell to keep people moving. These stairs sit in the middle of a busy lobby, where several spacious hallways tunnel into the lobby’s walls in all directions away from the base of the stairs. All the tunnel walls are lined with bookshelves. Little robots locked to dense rail lines on the ceilings rush high above Alka, darting into and out of the various tunnels. The little robots fly along the tracks so quickly that they only appear as glints of metal, closely weaving between each other before departing in every direction, filling the ceilings, and what looks like semi-silent clockwork sounds like light rainfall over a forest canopy. Most of the robots are firmly gripping various packages. Alka watches as one of the robots slows down, drops along a bookshelf, and picks a book up off of the shelves. Alka approaches the bookshelf and looks at the books tucked into the walls. Surprisingly, the books on this specific shelf are not labeled. Alka takes a random book, and a light above the bookshelf blinks in acknowledgement. Alka walks off, randomly choosing a tunnel and following it to its end.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 066] A small library den. Alka had followed the random tunnel down several turns until Alka could no longer hear the chaos from the library lobby. It’s very quiet now. Like the tunnels, the walls in this den are also lined with shelves, but instead of books, these shelves showcase collections of handmade pottery and various paintings. There are a few students working in this den. Alka walks closer to the shelves and looks at one of the bowls on display. This one bowl appears to have had a rough life: it had clearly been cracked in half and glued back together, but it is further scratched and dented as if it had been dragged down a flight of stairs over and over again afterwards. Alka can’t tell if this had been done on purpose. Most of the work on display seems to have been crafted by students.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 067] A short moment later, Alka is back in the tunnels, walking down another path. This tunnel is a bit longer and leads to the auditorium. It is also much wider, and a student on a bike nearly collides with Alka. Then Alka’s phone begins to ring again, but the ringtone is now silenced and the phone simply vibrates somewhere out of sight. This time Alka doesn’t bother to acknowledge it. Alka notices a nearby map on the wall and takes a closer look. As Alka examines the map, a few students passing nearby briefly glance at Alka as the phone continues to vibrate. Nobody seems to really care, and the phone doesn’t go on for long. Alka takes a closer look at the map. The map outlines the massive tunnel system that connects nearly all the buildings on campus. Alka then turns around and continues along the tunnels, this time walking with a destination in mind.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 068] The largest den is a dedicated study area, featuring a very wide column of windows at its center. The windows form the walls of a massive hole somewhere up on the lawn above. Alka walks towards the windows, passing sets of tables and chairs. At the end of the arrangement of tables and chairs is a space lined with soft, colorful couches, and all of them surround and face the column of windows. Alka walks right up to the glass. At the bottom of this hole is a small rock garden, a pond, a tree, and a statue. There doesn’t seem to be any way to get past the glass and into the garden, aside from jumping into the hole from the lawn above. The statue is that of a vague student, standing and gazing up at the open sky.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 069] Alka steps back and sits on the couch, taking a moment to appreciate the view. There are a few people sitting nearby, quietly working. Some of the people are sitting in small groups, whispering together. The garden beyond the glass is calmly absorbing the afternoon sunlight. Alka messes with the cuffs of Allias’ sweater once more before shaking the backpack off of Alka’s back. Among the many books in this backpack is a small, sturdy notebook. Alka pulls it out and quickly flips through its pages before taking out a pen, and after a short moment of arranged thinking, Alka eventually scribbles today’s date and writes: “a new lost wanderer named ‘allias’. on first sight, a warm light, i vomit. nice.” Alka holds the pen motionless over the page. At the moment this isn’t working for Alka, and the notebook eventually finds its way back into the backpack. The new unlabeled book, recently borrowed from this underground library, takes up a decent amount of space in Alka’s backpack. Alka drags the book out of the bag and opens it. After skimming through the first page, Alka attempts to sink deeply into the couch in a futile protest against the laws of physics, to become heavier, wanting to be as comfortable as possible in this corner of the campus that Alka had just discovered. Alka turns the page.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 070] Understanding a dog, from the perspective of a tree. It’s the last day, and my family is laying our beloved friend here to rest. They chose this spot, right here, next to me, close to the roots that have forever been here, longer than the lives of the few people near me. My family is digging, and they’re digging pretty deep. What was our dumb little dog thinking, I don’t know, but I want it. Our dog was so happy. This is my life, it is easy, all I have to do is make our family happy. My presence is more than enough. It doesn’t bother me, how I’m not able to do much with myself beyond that. I don’t have to worry about homework. Or a pitiful job. How I look. The meaning of my life, and other things. I’m already happy, because I don’t need to worry about myself, and I’m always surrounded by people, this little family, and today, until the rest of my life, our little puppy. This is me. This is all. This is everything. But still, I wonder, what was our dumb little dog thinking, I’ll never know, but I want it. Our dog was so happy.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 071] Understanding a human, from the perspective of a dog. Magic. It’s EVERYWHERE. They don’t even realize, everyone’s a WIZARD. They come, and they go, and the world keeps moving, the lights in the sky, the lights in the castle, the potions in the bowls that they summon to me every day, out of nowhere, they don’t even have to focus, they’re SO powerful. How do they DO it? Is it the better smelling elixirs they keep on the higher table? They never let me take anything from up there, I’ve only been able to swindle an unguarded taste in the past, a hasty kiss it was, it did nothing for me, I recall nil of any awakening surges of dormant, unfathomable energy, such power they must possess. I wish I could open doors.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 072] Understanding a tree, from the perspective of a human. Before Alka continues reading, Alka immediately looks ahead past the wide column of windows, where the tree sits in the middle of the rock garden. Alka’s attention then drifts to the statue of the student standing at the edge of the tree. Alka reaches back into the backpack and reopens the notebook. The unlabeled book slides off to the side as Alka grabs a pen and adds to today’s entry: “i should not have lied to allias”.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 073] The observatory. It’s early morning, and Allias is arranging the broken pieces of the kitchen table, trying to see how the pieces would fit together. Allias stands up and steps back, glancing once at the broken table before opening the kitchen cabinets surrounding the stove, searching for a toolbox. Allias then looks above the monster. Most of the storage in the observatory is suspended around and above the monster, arranged like a web with dozens of large metal boxes interconnected in a rising series of suspended metal walkways and ladders. The highest walkway leads to the highest point on the monster, where the highest of the holiday lights begins. At this peak there is barely any space between the very top of the monster and the domed ceiling of the observatory. Allias looks back at the broken table. Allias does not remember where the toolbox is, having not needed to use it for years.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 074] Eventually Allias is climbing the ladders up the monster, ignoring the sound of creaking metal. The web of holiday lights and suspended metal lightly sways as Allias climbs higher. It has been a very long time since Allias had last climbed up this metal web. Allias struggles to find the toolbox, searching through half of all the suspended storage boxes and climbing past three levels of ladders and walkways before pausing to take a break. It’s peaceful up in the monster’s web, but this part of the observatory has been untouched for so long that a thick layer of dust now coats everything, including the tops of the many little holiday lights. Allias pushes away from the current storage box and sits on the suspended walkway, clothes and hands covered in dust. The observatory door suddenly swings open. Allias peeks past the walkway railing and looks down at the open door, and Alka steps into the observatory. Alka is soaking wet for some reason.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 075] Before Allias is able to say a word, Alka runs to the monster’s keyboard and computer screen, rips both off of the monster, and smashes the tech against the floor. Pieces of metal fly everywhere as droplets of water fling off of Alka’s clothing. Allias yells in panicked surprise: “What are you doing?! Alka! Why?!” Alka looks up and yells back: “this horrid thing, it should not exist!” Allias scrambles down towards Alka, running across the walkways and nearly falling down the ladders: “Stop! Alka! No!” Alka is already looking at the nearest ladder, and Alka sprints towards it and leaps, slamming into the metal rods, and the entire metal web jolts to one side, causing Allias to trip and grab the nearest railing, and Alka barely manages to cling onto the ladder as it suddenly swings, and the sound of creaking metal transforms into a painful screech, a desperate attempt to resist destruction, but Alka persists and finds solid ground again, and in a smooth, surprisingly simple maneuver, Alka pulls the ladder, and the joints in the ladder and the walkway above give up and snap loudly, and in a dramatic, expensive collapse, the lower fifth of the suspended web of metal crumbles, falls, and smashes into the monster, and Allias, now hysterical and at a loss for words, desperately scrambles back up the ladders as the entire structure snaps and shakes. On the floor, Alka notices the impending catastrophe and sprints into the kitchen, desperately searching for cover as metal falls from the sky, and then Alka stares with what seems to be the same surprise shared by Allias at the show of destruction that had been accomplished so efficiently. The sound of metal tearing and impaling itself drowns out anything Allias yells at Alka from high above.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 076] When the falling is finished, it feels as if there is nothing but silence left in the observatory. The holiday lights are no longer on, and the monster, drenched in darkness, is no longer humming. Most of the monster’s web still dangles from the ceiling, but all that remains is too high above the floor for Allias to jump down without having to deal with an unbearable amount of pain. From the observatory kitchen, Alka looks up at the observatory dome where Allias is now stranded. Alka cannot see Allias, as Allias had retreated to the highest walkway in the monster’s web. Alka, still dripping wet, looks at the broken table on the floor. What remains of the monster vaguely resembles what the table looked like just after Alka slammed Allias through it yesterday. But the monster is so massive that only a portion of it has been ruined.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 077] There is debris everywhere, but the observatory door is not blocked. Alka decides against running off, looking up again at the monster’s web, searching for any sign of Allias. All of the metal storage boxes except for one remain suspended along the walkways. The one storage box that fell had cleanly torn through a metal panel in one of the bulkier parts of the monster. This storage box was the first of the boxes lined up next to what was the first lowest suspended walkway. Unknown to Allias, the toolbox was at the very bottom of this first box, unfairly hidden in plain sight, and upon crashing through the monster, the toolbox had popped out and claimed the largest remaining uncluttered space on the observatory floor before hurling its contents out and around it as if the glossy metal tools and screws were rose petals. Gripping the cables at the highest point on the monster, Allias is currently just staring at the affectionate display of tools far below, eyes shocked hollow.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 078] Alka makes the first move and walks into the center of the observatory, wet footprints squeaking onto the floor, and Alka looks up: “allias! where are you?!” It is much darker up in the monster’s web, and Allias is barely distinguishable against the metalwork. Allias doesn’t respond. Alka persists: “this is it, right?! you’re not even going to BOTHER?!” Allias can see Alka far down on the observatory floor, and Allias yells: “Alka?! Why?!” Alka is finally able to spot Allias up in the web: “it doesn’t matter, does it?! this is all fake! it’s all FAKE, right?! it’s all a figment of your imagination! you’re just going to FLIP out of this world at any moment! right?! allias?!” Allias yells down at Alka: “What are you talking about?!” Both of their voices echo in the observatory.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 079] Allias finds it strange how Alka had come to such a conclusion so quickly. After many years in the monster, working on countless worlds, Allias never had much difficulty in determining which world was really home, and while the thought of living in the wrong world was undeniably almost regularly present, it has never driven Allias insane, at least not to Alka’s level. There was a day, many years ago, when the monster was in its final stages of development, and it was the day Allias first had the opportunity to finally explore a world that fully, perfectly replicated the one that Allias defined as reality. Many people were with Allias at that moment, and only some of them went inside. The monster replicated the observatory and everything within and beyond, including all the people who remained outside at that moment, and the few conversations Allias had with them were flawless, from the way they talked about their deepest memories to the way the dust settled on the floor. Upon leaving the monster, it was as if Allias’ eyes had simply blinked, the worlds being perfectly indistinguishable, and it was strange to speak to those who remained outside. The only comfort Allias had was in the full understanding of how the monster actually worked. In fact, it’s one of the few comforts that Allias still has to this day. However, despite this understanding, Allias spent many days reflecting in a well hidden panic over what was true after that early moment, quietly tossing thoughts over and over until Allias came to a certain conclusion: what you define as reality is merely your own perspective and investment in a time and location. This time and location can be anywhere depending on where you decide to place most of the effort that defines your life. And for some people, including those as unusual as Allias whose effort has eventually become uniformly spread across multiple worlds, any attempt to define a single world as reality has somewhat lost its meaning.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 080] Alka then yells and points at Allias: “i want the truth! this world isn’t REAL!” Allias looks down at Alka and extends both arms outward: “I have no motive! What would be the point of me keeping you in a simulated world?” Alka: “…you’re harvesting my mind or body for some kind of project!” Allias: “Your mind and body combined are infinitely weaker compared to what this observatory is capable of. I will be blunt, Alka, I have zero use for you!” Alka: “then what is powering this place?!” Allias points one hand at the domed ceiling and another at the floor beneath Alka: “The sun! And this planet, its heat from deep within! There are no gimmicks here Alka!” Alka: “how can i trust you?!” Allias: “All the space flight records are public, and I’ve been the only person on this planet for years! We are not harvesting humans! Or any form of life whatsoever! I wasn’t even expecting anyone to come here, and then you showed up! Remember?” Alka desperately searches for more words to say, and Allias remains standing, up in the monster’s web, watching Alka. Alka’s clothing hasn’t dried off at all, and Alka is shivering now: “why is there no proof?! this world, are you really not able to tell if it’s real?!” Allias: “Please relax, Alka, I’ve got nothing on you! There really is no reason-” Alka: “i have no idea who you are!”
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 081] Allias sighs. Allias is struggling to find the words that Alka wants to hear. Allias doesn’t know what to say. Between the two of them, the metal monster waits in dead silence like a beast with several shattered spears through its corpse, and the morning sun spills through the windows and scatters helplessly across the observatory floor. Alka and Allias don’t speak for a moment. It is very quiet now. Then Allias moves slightly, causing the monster’s web to creak, and Alka looks up at Allias. Allias is pointing at the monster: “I will show you how it works, every part of the machine. I’ll rebuild and fix everything, I’ll go through every piece of it, even the parts that haven’t been broken… Your understanding will be my proof.” Alka: “i want my ship.” Allias: “What? Why?” Alka points at the monster: “that thing doesn’t know what’s in my ship, and you don’t know what’s in my ship. only i know, and i want to get to my ship.” Allias: “That task is impossible. The ocean is too deep.” Alka points at the monster: “this entire place is impossible! if you got THIS working, whatever it is, then you can get me down to my ship.” Allias points at the monster: “Whatever we experience in there is determined by both of us, not just me or the machine.” Alka: “i don’t care. i want my ship.” Alka is still dripping wet, and a small puddle of water is forming where Alka stands. Allias looks around at the storage boxes hanging nearby in the monster’s web, thinking. Allias: “Alright. I can do both.” Alka: “i get to my ship first.” Allias nods in the darkness of the observatory dome: “Alright.” Allias begins to descend down the monster’s web.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 082] Alka watches Allias from below, still shivering. Alka is still not convinced, and Alka is thoroughly uncertain about how to prove the validity of Alka’s own existence, and this terrifies Alka. It is somewhat quiet for a moment as Allias continues down along the ladders and walkways, the only sound in the observatory creaking from the joints in the suspended metal structure. When Allias reaches the lowest point in the monster’s web, Alka carefully walks over to the first thing laying on the observatory floor that resembles a ladder and stares at it. On the floor next to Alka is a potted flower, and next to it is a metal bar. This fallen bar had broken through the observatory floor, narrowly missing the flower. A few red petals are scattered on the floor around the pot as if the flower had shuddered, as if it knew it had narrowly missed certain death. Alka then steps back and looks up at Allias. Allias notices Alka’s hesitance: “You still don’t trust me, do you?” Alka: “no.” Allias steps away from the edge of the last suspended walkway: “Get out, walk away. Take some time to think. I’ll find my own way down.” Alka looks around at the scraps of metal before looking up again, only to discover that Allias had retreated back up the web. Alka leaves the observatory.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 083] Alka walks quickly, this time avoiding the shoreline and instead cutting directly into the grassy, rocky center of the island. Alka’s midsection hurts a little more than normal now, and its bandages now advertise a concerning, soaking blend of red and brown. Alka looks at the late morning sun. Alka is struggling to find a reason to trust Allias, but Alka never wanted to have to worry about trust at all. Alka notices how many people value their confidence in a few select individuals. It sometimes seems like most people are scared of what others will do to them, when in reality almost every single person they’ll ever meet will usually only have good intentions or just simply not care. This is certainly not true for everyone. This especially isn’t true for the extraordinary few who might have something that most other people don’t have, from a disproportionate amount of attention and wealth to the last parachute on the plane. People will always seem to find a reason to break the bond of trust, even when it is least expected, no matter how many years it took to form that bond. Alka has noticed how some people strangely treat themselves as if they are these extraordinary few. At the same time, after years of meeting several unique individuals between the stars, Alka eventually discovered that there are even some fewer of the few who curiously hold themselves as if they didn’t even deserve anyone’s trust at all. Alka never figured out how to quickly determine how trustworthy a person is, and after certain events in Alka’s past, Alka resorted to launching out into the deep space, letting go of the concept of trust with nearly every individual in the universe. For years, Alka actively avoided depending on anybody, and the concept of trust never surpassed the contract of faithfully shipping a package from one point in space to another. Alka now watches the clouds above, frightened by the possibility of the sky not being real, struggling to trust the soft, giving texture of the grass below Alka’s feet.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 084] In the observatory, Allias had managed to get the holiday lights hanging across the walkways to flicker on, giving the monster’s web a more tender atmosphere. The heart of the observatory now looks more like an exhibit of futuristic abstract art. The colors from the holiday lights trickle down only slightly, like the sprinkle of a springtime shower, and the late morning sunlight keeps the colorful light from above faint and weightless over the observatory floor. Allias is now carrying a long, folded length of rope, standing at the edge of the lowest remaining suspended walkway. Allias unwinds the rope and slowly lets it drop.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 085] By the time Alka returns, Allias is in the kitchen, working on a new pot of soup. It’s late afternoon. The ingredients of this new pot of soup are laid out on a new table, scrapped together from a carefully rounded metal panel from the monster and all that was salvageable from the previous table. Allias is sitting at this new table, chopping various vegetables. Allias looks at Alka as the observatory door clicks shut: “There’s still a little soup left from the previous pot. This new one will be ready in a few hours.”
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 086] Alka walks to the dining table and sits directly across from Allias. Allias continues to work through the dish as Alka sits for a moment at the table, quietly glancing over all the items scattered across its surface. Then, when Allias stops chopping to look at Alka, Allias notices Alka’s gaze. Before Allias has a chance to speak, Alka reaches and grabs one of the spare knives sitting on the table. Allias freezes, watching Alka. Alka then grabs a vegetable and starts chopping.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 087] Alka holds the knife carefully with every slice: “my ma, when i was younger, taught me every recipe in the world. i still remember all of them. recipes from all the cultures, i never questioned why my ma wanted to learn all of them. but my favorite ones used a lot of the same ingredients on this table. i spent many nights, just sitting at my ma’s table, cutting.” Allias relaxes and resumes chopping through the vegetables, but Allias continues to watch Alka’s handling of the blade. Allias’ gaze is now that of admiration. Alka doesn’t seem to be lying at all about those nights. Allias: “Do you know what I’m making?” Alka: “no, i have no idea how you were able to make your soup taste the way it did.” Allias: “There’s nothing really special about it.” The two of them chop vegetables in the afternoon sunlight.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 088] Eventually, their voices mix with the sound of the blades quickly tapping against cutting boards. It isn’t long before Allias comments: “I don’t really know what’s been going through your mind over the past few hours, but if you’re still wondering… I think there’s a lot more I can explain.” Alka is just watching Allias season a mix of ingredients now: “i just wished you gave me a better heads up before you put me in there.” Allias stops mixing and looks at Alka: “I’m really sorry.” Alka nods. Alka seems to be thinking elsewhere, and Allias continues mixing as Alka turns around and looks at the monster. Allias wonders about this seemingly quick change of mood in Alka over the past few hours. Alka then turns back to Allias and somewhat comedically points a hand back at the broken metal mess clearly in sight behind the two of them: “i didn’t really intend for it to actually break that much.” Allias laughs: “I’ve built it before, I can rebuild it again. It’s actually still mostly intact, as bad as it looks.”
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 089] Alka watches as Allias begins to toss ingredients into the pot. A few hours pass. Eventually Alka is sitting again on the sand just outside the observatory, watching the sunset. Allias props open the observatory door and walks out, holding a bowl of soup and a fresh set of clothes and bandages. Allias places the clothes and bandages on the sand next to Alka and then gently places the bowl of soup on top of the pile. Alka then takes the soup, notices the pile, and manages a small smile: “thanks.” Allias then turns away and walks back towards the observatory, and Alka turns and calls to Allias: “allias?” Allias stops at the propped door and looks at Alka: “Yeah?” The sunset is warm. Alka: “i never thanked you for saving my life.” Allias seems a little happier now: “You didn’t have to. Anyone would’ve tried to give you another chance.” Allias returns into the observatory, and Alka turns back to admire the horizon. The fresh, warm bowl of soup in Alka’s palms complements the warmth bleeding from the sun’s final act of the day, a familiar but priceless work of art that repaints itself before disappearing every night. Alka trusts Allias for now.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 090] The observatory kitchen. It’s nighttime. Allias sits alone, head and elbows on the new kitchen table, hands above and resting on top of Allias’ head. Allias is tired. Allias has avoided looking at the broken monster for most of the day. Allias is secretly regretting the decision that Allias had made in the beginning.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 091] The campus auditorium. It’s 7:49 AM. The lights are dimmed again, but this time the two massive projection screens at the front display the topic for today’s lecture. The professor is already standing at the front, having what seems to be an entertaining conversation with a few of the students sitting in the first row. Alka is already sitting at the back of the auditorium, in the same seat as yesterday. Alka can’t hear the conversation at the front of the auditorium, but Alka tries to guess what the professor is saying based on the expression on the professor’s face. On Alka’s lap, folded in a soft square, is Allias’ sweater.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 092] When Allias arrives, Allias takes the same seat next to Alka. Alka hands the sweater over as Allias sits, and Allias looks at Alka: “I thought you wanted to keep it?” Alka holds the sweater a little higher: “it’s yours, i wouldn’t want to ruin it for you.” Allias nearly insists that Alka keep the sweater, but at the front, the professor begins to speak, and the students all quiet down. Allias takes the sweater. The auditorium is the most elegant building on campus. The seats are all generously cushioned, and there is a subtle, cool breeze that flows along the descending rows, lightly bumping against the student’s shoes and backpacks, but the entire place feels warm and cozy despite how spacious it is. The walls and ceiling are made of wood, but the wooden panels have been angled and carved like a stone cave, and most of the panels are chiseled even further, and a closer glance reveals beautiful, sprawling landscapes. The auditorium lights are well hidden within the intentional cracks in the walls and ceiling, and each of the chairs has its own concealed light aimed at the ground, and when the lights are dimmed down, it feels as if thousands of candles were placed throughout the whole auditorium. Beneath each armrest is a surprisingly spacious retractable table. Alka struggles to get the table out and open, stopping briefly to retrieve the small, sturdy notebook out of Alka’s backpack. Allias notices that Alka’s backpack is full of random books. Allias pulls out a laptop.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 093] Alka looks at Allias’ laptop. It’s a brand new model, and it is incredibly clean, as if it had just been unpackaged. The display background image on Allias’ laptop is very unique, but Alka can’t tell what it is. There are no icons visible on Allias’ screen. Allias types a few keys and suddenly a new document appears. Alka watches as a few of the professor’s words gradually make their way to Allias’ screen. The notebook in front of Alka currently waits on a fresh page. This is the same notebook that Alka had written in yesterday. Alka and Allias continue to listen to the professor, the two of them quietly sitting in the back of the auditorium until the very end of lecture.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 094] The campus dining hall. Alka and Allias are sitting at their fifth floor table. Allias had gotten the same bowl of oatmeal and mug of hot chocolate, but this time Alka doesn’t say a word about Allias’ selection of food. During the walk to the dining hall, they had talked about how the professor seemed to have so much energy for a lecture that early in the morning. Allias is now looking at the design printed on Alka’s shirt. The shirt’s picture is different from yesterday’s design, but it seems to have been made by the same artist. Allias points at Alka’s shirt: “What is the picture printed on that shirt?” Alka stabs an omelette: “i have no idea, i found it in a box in my attic.” Allias: “Attic?” Alka clarifies: “back in my home far away, not here. this shirt belonged to one of my parents, probably.” Alka looks at Allias. The sweater Allias is wearing today looks exactly the same as the one Alka had handed to Allias earlier this morning. The sweater that Alka had handed to Allias is now sitting folded on the table next to Allias’ mug. Alka looks at Allias’ sweater: “you really do have multiple of the same exact sweater.” Allias: “I like this sweater.” Alka flips the omelette over on its plate: “i swear if you wear the same exact thing every day this whole year, as if you were a show character… is this our thing now? we go to class, we come here, you’re wearing the same thing, and you eat oatmeal?” Allias takes a sip of hot chocolate: “It’s only the second day.”
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 095] Allias looks out the windows overlooking the campus landscape. By now, essentially everything has already been discovered and explained when it comes to people and how to live, the only difference coming with context in the same way time changes the clothes that people feel comfortable wearing. The same fabric is repurposed and reshaped, and while big steps will occasionally be made in the fabric itself, at its core, clothing has long been thoroughly understood. Both Allias and Alka don’t expect to make a drastic change in the world that already seems to know so much, but they are both aware of how people are very good at forgetting how quite a few of the questions people ask today have already long been answered. They both also notice that some of the answers today are simply wearing a slightly different shirt.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 096] When Allias finishes the mug, Allias doesn’t leave and instead pulls out the brand new laptop and places it on the table. Alka, on the last bite of the omelette, immediately points at the laptop: “the background image on that, i want to see it again. what is it?” Allias turns the laptop around: “It’s for a game I’ve been working on for a while.” The background image is a somewhat crude but detailed drawing of a uniquely shaped mansion, and it appears to be floating in what seems to be nowhere. Alka puts down the fork and stares at the drawing: “you made that yourself? wow. can i see the game?” Allias turns the laptop away: “It’s not working yet. I thought you said you hated games…” Alka: “i never said that. i see why you think that, but that’s not what i meant.” Allias doesn’t bother to ask Alka to clarify and continues to work on the brand new laptop.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 097] Alka looks past the dining hall windows and points at the campus lawn down far below: “have you been in the tunnels beneath this campus? it’s like a whole other world down there.” Allias continues to look at the laptop: “I’ve heard of them, the rumors are that small sections of the tunnels are haunted…” Alka: “really? that has to be a joke.” Allias: “I’m not surprised either, by default every community seems to have its own ghost story. But actually, this one’s interesting because there’s actually some truth to it. The story isn’t about typical ghosts or anything like that. Apparently a lot of what happens down there is orchestrated by a computer program written by a select few students in one of the clubs on this campus. It’s strange, they let the students handle mail delivery here.” Alka: “how do you know?” Allias turns the laptop back to Alka, showing a campus web page: “There’s a whole list of all the student organizations online. I went through most of it last night.” Alka looks at the laptop: “anything stand out to you? are you planning on joining a few?” Allias: “Probably not.” Alka looks at Allias: “what do you mean? there’s so much to explore here, why?” Allias pulls the laptop back: “I’ve got a lot to do.” Alka: “what work? we’ve just started! there’s no way…” Allias doesn’t elaborate. Alka fills in: “no, don’t tell me you’re stuck working on that game…” Allias: “There’s a lot more than-” Alka: “we’re going to visit every club on campus.” Allias: “That’s insane. Neither of us have time for that, it’d take the whole semester, there’s too many-” Alka: “so what? you don’t know what might happen, maybe you’ll get inspiration for that game! come on.” Allias: “I don’t know…” Alka finishes the plate and stands: “alright, let’s go.” Allias: “What?”
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 098] They both head down into the campus underground library. Alka has the map layout mostly memorized now, and Alka rushes through the tunnels as Allias gawks at the busy scenery in awe while desperately trying to keep up with Alka. After a few turns, Alka stops at the student commons den. Many doors are lined up against the walls in this den, and there are various, countless posters and flyers stapled to many of the boards lining the walls between the doors, and a lot of them overlap or outright block each other as if the pages were competing for the light emitting from the suspended bulbs organized in the middle of the den. There are many large tables and benches beneath these bulbs, and there are many students sitting together, talking. Alka walks between the tables before approaching one of the walls, looking closely at the flyers. Allias follows behind Alka, staring up at the robots in the ceiling.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 099] The door next to Alka and Allias opens, and a robot descends and enters through the door. A student inside the room beyond this door notices Alka and Allias standing there and immediately stands and catches the door before it closes: “You two here for the meeting?” Alka immediately answers before Allias has a chance to speak: “yes.” This meeting member immediately steps aside and ushers Alka and Allias into the room, and Allias follows in suppressed frustration as Alka enters without question. It’s dark in this room, and Allias and Alka cannot see. Someone speaks: “Lights on.” The lights in this room flash on. There are about a dozen members sitting on the floor in this room, and one of them is standing before them all, and the dozen members flinch as their eyes adjust to the sudden flash of light. The standing member looks at Alka and Allias: “Who are these two idiots?” The member who opened the door closes it behind them: “New recruits.” The standing member: “You’re late. Lights off.” The lights flash off. They are all drenched in darkness again, and neither Allias nor Alka can see anything. Both of them sit down on the floor, for lack of a more respectable, immediate idea. Allias is terrified.
        </p> <p class="anim">[Alka &amp; Allias 100] A candle is lit. The standing member holds this candle, and all the members in this room gaze in silence at the candle. Allias now notices the logo printed on the breast of the standing member’s shirt: barely visible in the candlelight, but in happy, bold letters, the initials of the Student Mail Service.

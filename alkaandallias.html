        <p class="anim-typed">[ 1 ] As the sun sets, a soft sheet of golden sunlight settles across a peaceful island. An ocean softly curls around this island, around and around, slowly circling across the entire planet. Resting on one shore of this island is one solitary building, the only building on this planet. It is an observatory, and for years this has been the home of just one person. However, at the moment, there are two people on this planet. Allias drags Alka through the observatory door, both of them dripping wet. A tired, well-worn uniform clings to Alka’s limp body. The heavy door clicks shut behind the two of them. The sunset peeks through the observatory windows and casts shadows of Alka and Allias across stacks of equipment, sending flickers of golden gray across the metal, and the light rays fill the droplets flung from their soaked clothing. The shadows all fall when Allias slips, and Alka and Allias slam into the floor. The thud echoes within the observatory. Allias, shivering, pushes up against the floor and looks back in dread at Alka’s silent body. There’s nobody else to ask for help. Allias rises and continues to drag Alka, ignoring the desire to faint, ignoring how both are absolute strangers to each other, and ignoring the painfully red streak drifting on the floor behind Alka. Alka will die in a few hours.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 2 ] Allias rushes Alka into the heart of the observatory, where a monstrous bulk of metal rises to the domed ceiling. The sun has now completely set, and many lines of holiday lights carefully draped across the equipment have flickered on, synchronized to a small timer Allias had set several years ago. The little lights make all the metal panels shine in several subtle colors. Allias carefully lifts Alka onto a bed. This bed, the centerpiece of the observatory, is no ordinary bed. This bed is extremely comfortable. But more importantly, this bed lies directly beneath the monstrous bulk of metal, an elegant monstrosity of cables and metal arms enveloping the bed in a jungle of technology so complex that anyone could stare at it forever and still notice something new. As special as this monstrous structure is, Allias is nothing out of the ordinary. Allias’ story is unique out of circumstance, and as a person, Allias is dearly standard. In this world, all Allias has is a job. And Allias is not particularly exceptional at this job. Allias is now sitting at the small control station of the observatory, scanning screens and pushing buttons. But this is no typical observatory. This observer has little interest in the alignment of the stars.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 3 ] Alka arrived on Allias’ planet in a small, miserable spaceship. Equipment in the observatory had detected the vehicle many weeks before its arrival, but despite countless attempts, Allias was unable to establish any contact at all. Allias was already waiting on the shoreline just outside the observatory when Alka’s ship entered the planet’s atmosphere. Despite the spaceship’s battered appearance, its landing was executed almost flawlessly. The one flaw, to Allias’ surprise, was the vehicle’s decision to land way out in the ocean. As the vehicle gracefully approached the water, Allias was able to make out the logo printed proudly on the side of Alka’s ship: in happy, bold letters, the initials of the Space Mail Service. Allias was not expecting a delivery.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 4 ] After a short period of waiting and still no response from the crew, Allias figured that something had gone wrong and decided to take the swim out to the spaceship, bringing all that Allias has for the ocean: a single lifebuoy. The half-submerged vehicle hadn’t been damaged at all during landing, but the old spaceship was in terrible condition. This terrible condition made it easy for Allias to break in, and the very first thing that hit Allias was the scent of severe injury. Quietly strapped in and seated, the lone, lifeless body of Alka seemed to have been painting the control panels red, despite the soft landing. Allias nearly fell off of the vehicle in shock. The frighteningly cold water of the ocean suddenly became overwhelming, and it took Allias much effort to look back. The spaceship was already beginning to take in more water as Allias stepped into the cabin. By then, the evening sun no longer reached the inside of the spaceship, but it was clear that Alka was the only crew onboard. Had Allias not been there, Alka would have remained tucked within this darkened coffin, now lost to the cold depths of this planet’s ocean. It was at this moment, when Allias went to release the cabin’s hold on Alka’s body, that a new story in Allias’ career laid down its first words. Alka was still breathing. Alka was still alive.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 5 ] It was eerily calm right after Allias began to swim back to shore. Allias was barely managing to tow the limp Alka, but this rescue quickly became ridiculously difficult when Alka suddenly woke, took one look at Allias, and panicked: “…what is THIS?!” They both began to sink as Alka flailed: “this isn’t…” Alka then sharply inhaled in pain, gasping for air. Allias was now fighting both Alka and the ocean: “Relax! I’m saving-” The sunset was looking very beautiful when Alka punched Allias in the face: “NO!” Free of Allias’ grip, Alka then began to sink, and Allias dove in pain after Alka. When Alka and Allias resurfaced, Alka continued to flail as Allias tried to press Alka towards shore. Alka pushed away again: “let me GO!” Despite the lifebuoy, Allias struggled to keep Alka’s head above the water as Alka grew heavy in pain. Alka began to fade once again, gasping: “it’s cold…” This pain was crisp in Alka’s voice: “it’s so cold…” Alka seemed to be speaking to the clouds above: “where’s my-” Alka flailed again, smacking Allias as Alka panicked: “my SHIP?!” It had taken Allias a very long time to rescue Alka. Allias had never been in the water for this long. The ocean is always cold and thoroughly empty. Alka had passed out again right before they both got to the shore. And now, still shivering, Allias sits by the metal monster, strangely wanting more than anything for Alka to wake and say anything once more. Allias thinks about how it’s strange to feel more lonely with a silent someone than with no one.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 6 ] Allias is unbelievably exhausted, fighting off the pain from the evening’s rescue and the growing weight of sleep, but Alka doesn’t have much time left. The observatory’s metal monster is beginning to process Allias’ commands, and a soothing, whirling hum begins to fill the observatory. Allias knows that this monster wasn’t designed to bring people back to life. Allias’ job is far more intimate than that. But what Allias is doing now is nothing like what Allias has ever done in the past. As the quiet night sky flies above the observatory, Allias hopes that the coming moments will be of peace for the unknown stranger who was lucky enough to die on the Island of Mind.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 7 ] It’s difficult to convey beauty in the passage of time when there is little to expect. It’s easy to fill a dull moment with aimless fidgeting or wandering thoughts. It’s hard to say nothing happened and just leave it at that, a blank page. Allias refuses to admit that life is often a blank page. There is a genuine truth in nothingness that people want to challenge. Nearly all people take this challenge, and the result of all this together creates something catastrophically beautiful.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 8 ] The painful truth is that both Alka and Allias amounted to nothing in the end.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 9 ] The catastrophic challenge begins when Allias decides to fully engage the monster, pushing the final buttons, watching the screen light up, with Alka drawing from a handful of painful, dying breaths on the extremely comfortable bed beneath the dizzying bulk of observatory equipment, and this bulk, this monster, suddenly roaring to life at Allias’ command, and the roar is more orchestral than mechanical, a mess of a hum from the largest orchestra to ever exist, with every instrument tuning to different notes, and some of the instruments are people, a sizable choir, and one of the instruments seems to be playing its own melody, and then the holiday lights scattered throughout the observatory start to dim and flicker as the monster draws in more energy, and soon the noise collects itself and collapses into something pleasant, like the theme of a stream at the toes of several mountains, spinning around the roots of aged trees, and it starts to get dark, very dark, but pleasantly dark, like the dark of the excitement before a premiere of a film you’ve been forever wanting to see, or what the night sky feels like when you’re watching it with someone you love. As the theme continues, Allias leaves the screen and walks towards the bed where Alka rests. Allias lays on the bed next to Alka, both of them now beneath the monster, and Allias’ eyes close. This is the story of Alka and Allias.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 10 ] An auditorium. By the time Allias arrives, almost every seat is taken. Allias knows a few of the students sitting in this class, but the connection is only vague: a small, fleeting set of smiling faces that once wandered through the hallways of Allias’ memory. Allias can’t see any of them right now. Hundreds of students are in this auditorium, and for some reason, the lights are dimmed as if a few movie trailers were about to play on the two massive screens up on the main stage. Allias takes one of the few remaining seats at the back of the auditorium.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 11 ] The back of the auditorium. The door behind Allias swings open and slams against the wall, causing the students sitting nearby to jump a little, and some of them turn around. And then, when another student like them enters, they immediately relax and turn away. Alka is one of the last people to arrive for class. There is an open seat next to Allias, and Alka quickly takes it. Alka is in a little bit of a mess: disheveled clothing, wide eyes, and a backpack clutched aggressively in one hand. Allias doesn’t stare at Alka and only notices Alka’s phone. It’s an old model, and its screen is shattered. Alka places the phone on the armrest between the two of them.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 12 ] They don’t say anything to each other. The scene is new to both of them, and it’s taking them both a few tries to make sense of everything: numerous heads of varying hairstyles, new voices buried between unfamiliar words, that one lost student still searching for a seat, and a few people a few rows ahead furiously scrolling through maps on different devices. Nobody really knows anybody. The visible, eager, energetic fear seems to be shared by everyone at once. The auditorium goes dark. All the students immediately shut up as a dramatic, low, musical tone rolls across the darkness, and a voice rises and echoes above the noise. This tone crashes against all the walls in the auditorium, but the voice is warm and surprisingly energetic. It’s 8:00 AM.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 13 ] Alka shifts uncomfortably, causing a notebook to fall out of Alka’s backpack. Allias, the only person nearby who can barely hear Alka above the introduction, looks worriedly at Alka but doesn’t have time to speak before Alka, still clutching the backpack, nearly plunges into the darkness beneath the chair, searching the floor: “i can’t do this…” Alka finds the fallen notebook and zips up the backpack. Allias is immediately distracted by the voice as it suddenly bursts with enthusiasm, building an avalanche of words, capturing many of the thoughts stirring in all the students’ heads, speaking of the future, of challenges, of career, of adventure, of love, speaking until the musical number reaches a climax, and all the students are mesmerized as all the lights in the auditorium flash on. On stage, the professor stands in a welcoming pose, a microphone in hand. Nearly all the students are clapping now, and many start to laugh as the professor begins to bow animatedly. The two massive screens brightly snap to a clean greeting. This is Allias’ first day of college. Allias smiles, turning to look at Alka. But Alka is no longer there.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 14 ] Allias then looks below Alka’s empty seat and notices Alka’s phone. It had fallen off the armrest and now sits alone, its shattered face barely visible beneath the seat. Without hesitation, Allias grabs the phone and rushes out of the auditorium. Nobody is in the hallways except for Alka and Allias. Several lectures are going on at once, and faint voices echo above the distant squeaking of Alka’s shoes against the floor. Allias catches the very last second of Alka, at the far end of the hallway, plowing an awkward half-flip through a restroom door. Gripping the phone, Allias follows Alka.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 15 ] When Allias enters the restroom, Alka is over a sink, both hands firmly on the handles of a fully running faucet. There’s already another student nearby, asking if Alka is alright. Allias walks forward with Alka’s phone in one hand. The reflection of Alka is sharp in the mirror above the sink. Alka waves a dismissive hand, still glaring into the running water: “i’m WONDERFUL.” Alka doesn’t further respond to the nearby student, who then looks at Allias and shrugs before walking off. Allias places the phone on the sink near Alka’s hand: “Is this yours?” Alka doesn’t even look at the phone: “i’m fine, thanks.” Alka’s phone then begins to ring, and Allias can’t help but notice the names flashing on the phone’s screen. There are several missed notifications, and Alka’s parents are calling again. Alka finally looks up from the sink, only to take the phone and silence it.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 16 ] Before Allias begins to walk off, Alka shuts the faucets and looks at the reflections in the mirror: “anyone else notice how beautiful this room is?” The ceilings are impressively high for a restroom, and there is a beautiful chandelier just above the heads of Alka and Allias. Everything is spotless and sparkling. Allias notices how the chandelier looks like a small maze of miniature staircases and how the marble tiling beneath them is laid in an unnecessary pattern that would’ve taken many painstaking hours to put together: “I see. It’s hard to believe, the whole campus is like this.” Alka: “huh. maybe we’re dreaming. i certainly wish i was.” Allias thinks about this before nodding and walking off.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 17 ] The walk back to the classroom is very slow for Allias. In a very restful stroll, Allias pays more attention to the little details of the hallway outside the restroom doors. Each detail is a small, private celebration because Allias did something nice today. But with each step, a discomforting thought grows in Allias’ head. Allias is familiar with the suspended feeling of being in a completely new place, having no idea where any of the doors lead, uncertain about which way home is, and it holds your breath slightly until the world has comfortably loaded itself into your brain. And, there’s another feeling when you know you’ll be in this new place for a long time, long enough to develop intense memories. This is the feeling that makes one new place more distinct than other new places. Distinct enough to form the core of some people’s lives, possibly even a recurring setting for their dreams. Many don’t notice these feelings until they happen, and sometimes, when they happen, they hit hard. Some people don’t like to talk about these thoughts, and most want to get over these thoughts immediately. New places are temporarily discomforting by default. Allias thinks this discomfort is strangely pleasant. But for the first time since arriving on this beautiful campus, Allias feels empty, and Allias can’t pinpoint why.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 18 ] Alka exits the restroom, and upon seeing Allias still walking in the hallway, Alka calls out: “hey!” Allias turns in fear, worried that something has gone wrong. Alka waves the phone at Allias: “thanks for this.” Allias relaxes: “You’re alright?” Alka doesn’t seem to be returning to class: “what’s your name?” The hallway is filled with morning light, and the light dances slightly with the leaves of the many trees lined against the auditorium building. There is a small break in the line of trees for a small flower garden, and the center of this garden has a small pond surrounded by several ornamental benches. The sunlight bouncing from this pond is a little brighter, filling the hallway space between Alka and Allias. Allias (AH-lee-is): “Allias. Yours?” Alka (AHL-ka): “alka. thanks, allias.” Allias doesn’t question where Alka is going: “Goodbye.” As Alka walks away, Allias quietly pushes back through the auditorium door.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 19 ] Alka immediately enters the nearest stairwell and takes the flight to the higher floors of the auditorium building. At the moment, Alka wants to be anywhere but here, but here seems to be everywhere. The thoughts in Alka’s mind are confusing, and the only thing that makes sense is the constant beating pattern of Alka’s footsteps. The upper floors of the auditorium building are full of galleries, but the galleries feature very little art. Instead, the walls are covered in awards and commemorative slabs. Alka passes several walls featuring alumni and notable individuals. Some of the galleries are filled with gifts from various organizations, and one of the gifts is a massive, elegant clock cabinet. Despite the clock grabbing Alka’s full attention, the time doesn’t register in Alka’s mind. Eventually, Alka walks through a set of galleries dedicated to the top funders of this campus, and the very last one is the largest gallery in the building. Its entrance is an entirely handmade wooden arch with a golden plaque named after the highest donor: Standard Model Software. Alka’s uniform walk comes to an abrupt stop at the entrance to this gallery. For a brief moment, Alka stands there, delicately looking at the golden letters. The thoughts in Alka’s mind suddenly realign, and the expression on Alka’s face goes cold. Alka checks the time, turns around, and walks back to class.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 20 ] Inside the auditorium, the professor walks across the stage, pointing at the massive screens. Allias is absently watching the logos that fly behind the professor. They are familiar logos, representing many of the most successful companies and products of this world. The logos suddenly disappear, and a childhood image of the professor in a very poor state fills both screens. The professor begins to talk passionately, and a humble slideshow of the professor’s lifetime career begins to unveil itself. The professor points many times at the audience, speaking eloquently. Allias briefly looks around. The professor has the attention of every student in the auditorium. Despite the motivating speech, Allias still feels empty. Allias’ thoughts are currently centered on the earlier exchange at the mirror with Alka. It was obvious that Alka was in distress. But that whole time, Allias didn’t know what to do. Allias didn’t know what to say. Allias wonders why people don’t always find the right words, which is strange when there are seemingly infinite ways of putting words together. Allias also wonders why people sometimes expect words to be said regardless of their effectiveness. Sometimes most of the difficulty comes not with which words to use but rather with how the words will be received, be it in empty promises, muddy reassurance, or a relatable story. Especially when little is known, words can fall anywhere between destructive and healing, regardless of the initial intent.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 21 ] The door behind Allias doesn’t slam when Alka re-enters the auditorium. Alka sits in the same open seat next to Allias: “did i miss anything?” Allias begins to pay attention to the professor: “I… don’t think this will be on the exam.” The two of them sit in the darkness, quietly listening for the remainder of the class.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 22 ] Alka wakes up. Something metal whirls and retracts away from Alka’s face. Little lights are blinking everywhere around Alka. For a moment, Alka lays there on the comfortable bed, staring blankly. Alka is completely surrounded by machinery, and it is overwhelmingly unfamiliar. The tension in Alka’s head quickly grows until Alka freaks out and throws a punch at the monster. Everything starts to move at once, and the monster’s cables and metal arms instantly retract from Alka. Alka rolls and tumbles off the bed and crashes onto the floor, and a sudden, searing pain fills Alka’s stomach. Alka looks down. There is a massive bandage over Alka’s entire midsection.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 23 ] The observatory. Groaning, Alka leans back and grabs the edge of the bed, looking around. The early morning sunlight peeks through the equipment, but the holiday lights are still on. Some of the lights dangle from the observatory ceiling, and some of the lights drop down to the floor around Alka and wrap neatly around dozens and dozens of potted plants. Nearly all the plants are flowering. Half of the flowers are colorful geraniums, and all of the flowers are blooming wildly. Alka pushes away from the bed, looking around before hurrying in a confused stumble out of the monster, following the vague rays of the sunrise.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 24 ] Alka eventually starts to run, bumping into metal sections of the monster and stumbling over the potted flowers. Alka then sees Allias. Allias is sitting at a small dining table in the kitchen, already waiting for Alka. Alka stops and stands at a distance, eyes locked in terrified confusion at Allias. Before Allias has a chance to explain, Alka launches into a sprint and tackles Allias. Allias blindly throws both hands forward in fear: “Wait! AaaAAA-” The two of them slam into the kitchen table, brutally demolishing it, and Alka recovers in a chaotic flip. Allias yelps and crashes against the kitchen stove, shaking a freshly made pot of soup.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 25 ] Alka stumbles a little before launching again at Allias: “where IS IT?!” Allias, on the floor, throws both hands in the air: “What?! Help! I helped!” Alka blindly trips over a piece of the shattered kitchen table and violently falls face-flat, further shattering what remains of the table. Allias slides away from the loud mess, hands still up: “Wait! Wait! I saved your life! I don’t want to hurt you!” Alka rolls over on the floor in pain, gripping the bandages around Alka’s midsection. The bandages have gone a little red. Still clearly confused, Alka manages to sit up on the floor: “…what?” Allias remains on the floor at a distance: “Do you remember? Your spaceship, it landed in the ocean. I tried to rescue you…” Alka immediately stands and scans the observatory for an exit, stumbling: “my SHIP!”
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 26 ] Alka spots the observatory door and sprints again. Allias watches: “Where are you going?! You need to rest!” Alka shoves the door open and looks outside: “my ship! in the OCEAN.” Alka runs out of the observatory. Allias: “There’s no way-” The observatory door clicks shut. Allias sits alone in the observatory.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 27 ] Alka runs across the sand and stops before the shoreline. The ocean is quiet and calm, and there’s a soft mist in the air. The silent morning sunrise fills this mist. Alka leans over and touches the ocean. It’s freezing. Alka stares with fixed intent at some random point in the distance. Alka then takes a few steps back, runs, and leaps as far as humanly possible into the ocean. The beach is very short, and the ocean floor immediately leads to a submerged ledge, a sharp drop into cold, total darkness. Alka stares with wide eyes into the deep nothingness. Finding the spaceship now would be impossible. Alka then resurfaces, splashing in the ocean and gasping for air. Alka screams.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 28 ] It’s not long before Alka is back on shore, running along the perimeter of the island, shivering, eyes following the shoreline. The sun is a little higher now, and the mist is starting to clear. Alka continues to run. Alka usually finds it difficult to understand why many people are happy to stay in one place for most of their lives. When the span of the world seems infinite, Alka finds it strange that only a few aimlessly wander. When many come across a tiny part of the world that feels comforting, that curious drive takes a back seat, sometimes backing far enough to never be seen again, despite the millions of places out there that come close to or even exceed that level of comfort. From the world outside their bedrooms to the worlds outside all boundaries, the entirety of the world outside their own is summarized into the limited glimpse of what they’ve seen and known. But most people don’t have a choice. Alka continues to run, shivering. After many moments like this in Alka’s life, Alka wonders: maybe they’re right. In the deep, infinite ocean, there are many beautiful gems, but the ocean is so deep and infinite that the gems might as well not exist. Several hours in the ocean can do anything to a person. Alka continues to run, not exactly knowing why.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 29 ] It is often easier to cross a physical distance than a mental one. They are both distances that every person crosses for the entirety of life, and every person has different ways of crossing them. Rarely do the distances reach the same destination. Many people are happy in the world of their minds, whether they honestly like it there or not, and many find fulfillment in sharing theirs with others. But when minds become conflicted, many people tend to find the first opportunity to cross a physical distance, avoiding the mental bridge, fearing that the pain in the hostile tampering of the thoughts and memories that define you rivals that of which the upcoming physical torment achieves. It is easier to let bridges collapse over growing oceans, turning worlds into isolated islands. It is hopeless to cross a heartless ocean if a person already believes that the other island is just as cold as the water. Some people can’t even navigate their own islands, and some people don’t realize they even have an island. And then there are some who could simply care less about the holes deep within their own and don’t mind the sinking. It’s just a destination, and all the people together create a beautiful map. A map for the even rarer some who love to sail.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 30 ] It is now the end of the day. Alka has reached the end of the full loop around the entire island. The entire journey was full of nothing but an entirely flat landscape of sand, ocean, grass, and rock. Alka now strolls softly, eyes tiredly pointed towards the observatory. Allias is sitting in the sand outside the observatory, watching the sunset.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 31 ] Alka approaches Allias. The color of the sunset is warm. Alka’s voice carries across the water hugging the shoreline: “is this all this planet is? this island, that building… and that miserable ocean?” Allias looks at Alka: “Yes. It’s very peaceful.” Alka glances around: “are you really alone here? you don’t have any way off of this planet?” Allias notices the poor condition of Alka’s bandages: “Did you spend the entire day running across this island? You should sit down…” Alka: “i don’t have time… i need to keep going.” Allias pats the sand: “You have time, take a break.” Alka: “i can’t-” Allias: “There’s nowhere else to go. Please.” After a moment, Alka relents and sits down. Surprisingly, Allias seems more tired than Alka. Allias looks back at the sunset: “What do you remember? How did you find this place?” Alka then looks at the observatory and points at it: “how long was i in there?” Allias: “Only two nights. What do you remember?”
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 32 ] Alka looks at the sunset, taking a breath before speaking: “i was making deliveries.” Allias pivots slightly on the sand to face Alka: “What were you delivering?” Alka: “i just deliver the packages. it’s not my business to know what’s inside them.” Allias: “I wasn’t expecting a delivery.” Alka: “that’s not my job to know.” Allias: “Can’t the ships fly themselves?” Alka sighs: “the packages i deliver require top security.” Allias: “Do you want me to contact the Space Mail Service? Should I tell them you’re here?” Alka throws a confused look at Allias: “you didn’t do that already?” Allias: “…No. I wasn’t sure who you were. I got no contact from you as your ship approached… I assumed you didn’t want anyone to know you’re here. You’re badly injured…” Alka looks blankly at the water: “they’ll know i’m here anyway.” Allias: “Should I still try to contact them?” The water hugging the shoreline is nearly as calm as the sun. Alka hesitates: “…no.” Allias: “No?” Alka, more deliberately: “no.” Allias asks doubtfully: “Is there something that I should know?” Alka: “i need to keep going.” Allias: “What? Why?” Alka: “there are two packages left. i need to deliver them.”
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 33 ] Allias lets a moment of silence set in, unsure of what to do with this information. The sunset continues quietly, passing through a thin layer of clouds and dipping slowly into the ocean. Both Alka and Allias now know two important things: 1) two packages are stuck in a sunken spaceship at the bottom of the ocean, and 2) two people are sitting on a secluded island on a planet at the bottom of the universe. One of the packages is destined for Allias, and one of the two people is destined to venture out into space to deliver the final package. At this point in the story, Allias knows what has to be done, but finding the most meaningful way to do it is challenging.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 34 ] Alka finally breaks the silence: “i should say, i owe you. i thought i wouldn’t make it here alive… but here i am.” Allias responds carefully: “You owe me nothing. I don’t need anything. All I want is for you to know that you are safe here. You’ll be alright. We’ll figure this out.” Alka doesn’t respond. Allias then gets up, brushing off sand: “Let’s go inside. I have some soup waiting.” Allias begins to walk back to the observatory, and when Alka remains sitting on the sand, Allias stops: “Is there something else?” Alka looks directly at Allias: “who are you? why are you out here, alone?” Allias starts walking again: “I’ll tell you my story inside.” Alka calls after Allias: “can i at least get your name?” Allias turns around: “Allias. And yours?” Alka: “alka.” Alka returns to staring at the darkening sky as if it were an empty wall: “it’s beautiful out here, allias.” A very subtle warmth briefly lingers in the sand at the end of the day. Allias walks back to the observatory, and Alka remains sitting on the sand until the warmth fades away.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 35 ] The campus lawn. After the very first class of their college career, two ordinary students walk out of the auditorium building and join the busy crowd walking across the lawn to the next set of classes. By ordinary chance, these two students don’t have classes for the next hour, and they both haven’t eaten yet today. The morning sunlight fills the trees and scatters over well-trimmed grass. A quiet breeze occasionally flickers the leaves, casting a bright green feeling across all the students. Alka and Allias are walking to the campus dining hall.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 36 ] Allias squints at the small panels next to the buildings, trying to find the one labeled for dining: “Are we headed the right way?” Alka walks a little faster than Allias, held in place only by the pace of the crowd: “sure. allias, what do you think about our professor?” There are a lot of geese on the lawn. Allias: “So much energy, for this early in the morning.” Seated at the front row of Allias’ mind is the curiosity over Alka’s earlier suffering at the beginning of class. Reading Alka’s face now, Allias can’t find a trace of that moment, and it even seems like Alka doesn’t want Allias to ask at all. Out of respect, Allias remains quiet on the subject, but this strange, empty helplessness is the only reason Allias is with Alka right now. Allias wants to help Alka, but there’s nothing to be done. Alka: “i LIKE that. our professor is motivated. i felt like i belonged there, listening.” Allias looks at the geese on the lawn: “The staff here are probably paid really well.” At this, Alka immediately changes the subject: “which dorm did you choose?” Allias is distracted by the geese: “What?” Alka: “your dorm, where are you staying?” Allias: “The one by the lake.” Alka: “no way… isn’t that the oldest building on this campus?” Allias can now see the dining hall at the end of the lawn: “I don’t know. I just like the lake.” Alka: “don’t you have to walk to another building just to do laundry?” Allias wonders what the geese on the lawn are thinking: “I don’t mind the walk.” Alka starts to walk a little faster as the crowd begins to thin out: “huh. i’ve really got to check out this lake.”
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 37 ] The campus dining hall. Alka and Allias enter through two sets of intricately carved wooden double doors. They walk into a grand hallway with intricately carved wooden columns, each rising to the roof of the building. The two furthest columns feature two beautiful grand staircases. The building is five floors tall, and each floor features a unique buffet. A summary of the menu is displayed on a large, colorful screen in the middle of the hallway. Alka stops to watch the menu gradually animate through a list of showcase dishes, and Allias continues towards the nearest buffet table, eyes locked on a steaming metal cauldron. By the time Alka walks away from the menu screen, Allias is holding a bowl of oatmeal. Allias scans the nearby dining tables: “Where should we sit?” Alka notices the bowl in Allias’ hands and furiously points at it: “that’s it?” Allias looks confusedly at the bowl: “What?” Alka: “this place has the most food i’ve ever seen in my life… and all you get is OATMEAL? get something more, or i’m leaving you here.” Allias looks dejectedly at the bowl of oatmeal.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 38 ] Alka and Allias agree to walk by every buffet table on all five floors in the dining hall. After touring the fifth floor, they find two seats with a nice view overlooking most of the campus. The campus is surrounded by heavy forest on one side and an endless ocean of prairie on the other. A large lake sits at the edge of the campus, comfortably enveloped by the forest. A small city is barely visible at the other edge of campus, and a few more towns are clustered even further away. The tallest building in sight is the auditorium from which Alka and Allias had just left. Allias watches as Alka carefully lowers two crowded plates of food onto the table. The plates are a messy collection of small bits taken from nearly every available dish they passed by. Allias had already finished the bowl of oatmeal during this little tour of the dining hall. Allias now holds a mug of hot chocolate and focuses on the clouds waiting on the horizon.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 39 ] At the moment, Alka and Allias are the only people on the fifth floor. This dining table that Alka and Allias have chosen feels like an eagle’s nest, tucked within one of the most beautiful places overlooking the campus. Because most students avoid the long trip up the grand staircases to the fifth floor, this little nest is partially secluded. The sunlight is bright and filling, and it quietly warms the faces of Alka and Allias. They both notice this, but neither of them acknowledges it.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 40 ] The two of them talk about little things, like the people they’ve seen over the past few days or the classes they each have lined up for the semester. Alka appears particularly ordinary now, and the strange emptiness Allias had felt has mostly subsided. Allias asks: “When’s your next class?” Alka focuses on an omelette while speaking: “i don’t have another lecture until tomorrow. i’ll probably see you there, since it’s for the same class from earlier, in the auditorium.” Allias lifts an empty mug and prepares to leave: “Ok. I’ve got to go now, I’ll see you then.” Alka is focused on cutting through the omelette with a fork: “you’re leaving?” Allias rises from the dining table: “Yeah.” Alka sticks the fork in the omelette, looking at Allias: “you didn’t get anything else besides oatmeal!” Allias, now standing, places the empty mug on the table in front of Alka: “What about this?” Alka glances at the mug: “that doesn’t count. is that really all you’ll try? you are most definitely missing out.” Allias points at the mug: “I got exactly what I wanted, and I enjoyed it.” Alka: “oatmeal is not a personality.” Allias, confused: “What?” Alka: “what else do you want me to say?” Allias points at Alka’s two plates: “We each know what we want. You knew what you wanted, so that’s what you got, right?” Alka takes a bite of the omelette: “no. i don’t have the slightest idea.” Allias: “What?” Alka points the fork at the two plates: “look at this, this here. i couldn’t possibly know what i’d like out of everything if i didn’t know what anything in everything was.” Allias: “…What?”
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 41 ] Allias notices that first conversations don’t often reveal who people really are. Curiously, given enough effort, it is unfairly simple to describe all the thoughts that amount to one person, but it is rarely the priority to summarize these thoughts as they are. People instead tend to express themselves in the same way films or video games are promoted, in the spirit of trailers or cover art: carefully crafted to make people think a certain way, hiding some key elements, sometimes focusing on relatable or alluring features, sometimes focusing on connections to other famous people or ideas, and sometimes staying completely vague. But there are the rare people who, beginning from the first encounter, will describe themselves thoroughly, disregarding spoilers, unafraid of their immediate vulnerability, and these people tend to be the most precious of the ridiculous. At the same time, Allias thinks there is no meaningful correlation between those who are good at talking and those who are just good people.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 42 ] Alka stops eating and puts down the fork: “alright. say you’ve got a blank sheet of paper. how do you paint if you’ve only used pencils?” Allias starts to walk off again: “I don’t understand.” Alka: “i have no idea who you are.” Allias stops: “What? I’m not-” Alka: “just ONE thing.” Allias sighs and tries to answer the question: “If I had a blank sheet of paper, I’d make a game.” Alka pauses briefly: “like, a real-life game? or computers?” Allias is thrown off: “How would I…? Maybe a computer game. I don’t-” Alka: “that’s cool! you should go for that. this world is nice. so many people with beautiful dreams.” Confused, Allias gives up and leaves: “Wonderful. Goodbye, Alka.” Alka picks the fork back up and continues eating: “i guess so, allias.” It is a shame that the cloud-scattered sky is as beautiful as it is, as it steals the spotlight from the even more magnificent and colorful galaxies on the broader horizon.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 43 ] The observatory kitchen. Allias ladles some soup into a large bowl and hands it over to Alka. It’s nighttime, and Alka is already wearing a fresh set of bandages: “your soup is a little… bland.” Allias looks at the bowl in Alka’s hands: “Oh.” Allias then leans against the kitchen counter and glances at the monster: “I’m sorry. I’ve forgotten about that. My job, it gives me the opportunity to try anything, all kinds of food, flavors beyond all that’s possible. But my soup, it’s like home for me.” The two of them stand in the kitchen, eating the bland soup. What remains of the kitchen table now sits in a neatly organized pile of broken pieces. Alka looks at the pile: “did all that happen before coming here?” Allias is confused: “What?” Alka: “your job. all that food you’re talking about. did you travel before coming to this planet?” Allias laughs a little: “No. All that happened in there.” Allias points at the monster, and Alka looks at it confusedly. Alka: “am i missing something? is that some kind of teleport?” Allias walks forward towards the monster: “No, it’s much better than that. Would you like to see?” Alka puts an empty bowl on the kitchen counter.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 44 ] The monster is quietly humming, and the nighttime sky fills all of the windows in the observatory. Allias leads Alka right up to the bed beneath the massive bulk of metal. Allias stands proudly: “This is the heart of the observatory.” Alka touches the bed: “this looks nothing like an observatory. why is your bed in the middle of it?” Allias: “This observatory observes much more than just the stars.” Alka looks up at the cables above: “what do you mean? i don’t get it. where’s the food.” Allias: “This observatory doesn’t observe this world.” Alka: “so… parallel universes? you travel between alternate worlds?” Allias: “Well, no, and yes, not really. The worlds I visit aren’t exactly real.” Alka: “what? the food’s not real?” Allias looks at Alka: “Alright, alright. I get it. You don’t like my soup.” Alka: “no, i don’t get it. what am i looking at? why is your bed here?” Allias steps back: “I am an artist. World-maker. I plan out worlds and simulate them for my clients. You are on the Island of Mind, a secret maker sanctuary. This observatory, it’s the ultimate tool of creation. It is the quickest and most freeing way to create. This is the artist’s final tool. This is the best, it can’t get any better.”
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 45 ] Alka and Allias stand there silently for a moment. Alka looks around: “ah. this place makes sense now. you, alone on this planet.” Allias smiles expectantly: “Yeah?” Alka nods: “yup. you’re insane.” Allias steps forward, frustrated: “What? Look, it’s right here. We’ll prove it!” Alka: “let me guess. i get on that bed, and then i fall asleep. you invade my dreams, turn them all into nightmares. my brain turns into soup. and then i’ll be trapped in there forever. i DIE. the end.” Allias is visibly confused: “What??” Alka continues: “or even worse, you force me to enter YOUR nightmares, and then i get lost in whatever mess is happening in your head, and while i’m out, you harvest my brain power, my thoughts, and then, oh no, i’m trapped again on this death bed. my brain turns into bland SOUP. i-” Allias: “No! Hold on. No. That’s not how this works.” Alka: “what is it then? i’m not getting in BED with you!” Allias: “What?! No! Let me explain-” Alka: “who are you?” Allias steps back: “Look. This place, this observatory. All I do is make worlds. Art. And it’s all self-contained. It can’t actually hurt you, I can’t actually hurt you, even if I wanted to, even if you wanted to. The observatory can’t kill you, you can’t get lost in there, it can’t trap you, it’s none of whatever you just said. Time is different in there, but it’s not infinite. You can leave whenever you want to. It is all up to you. It’s just a tool, like a paintbrush.”
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 46 ] Alka looks around at the surrounding machinery: “so, do i actually have to get in that bed?” Allias: “Do you want to see how it works?” Alka: “why not?” Allias sighs tiredly and sits on the edge of the bed: “Alright. Just sit. That’s it.” Alka sits on the bed: “like this?” Allias doesn’t even look: “Yeah.” Nothing happens. The two of them sit there beneath the cables and panels of metal and blinking lights as the monster continues to hum. Alka looks around absently: “now what?” Allias: “Just relax.” The monster roars to life. Suddenly Alka and Allias are standing in empty space. Alka can’t see the floor that they’re standing on, but they are both weighted to it. Alka looks above, and then Alka looks below. It feels as if there are two skies: a deep black sky high above and a wide white sky far below. Nothing else. Allias watches as Alka starts to walk around: “Still think I’m insane?” Allias’ voice does not echo. Alka looks at Allias with a curious expression: “yeah. where are we?” Allias sighs, extending both hands towards Alka: “Alright. Here, try this, think of something small, maybe a drop of water, and try to place it in my hands.” Alka focuses.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 47 ] The empty space suddenly flips into a music store. Allias panics: “What?! Woah! Slow down!” Alka and Allias are both immediately younger and now stand next to various sets of shiny drums. There’s a person sitting behind a short welcoming counter by the front door. The counter is surrounded by various small pedals, plugs, and panels. The person behind the counter isn’t paying much attention to anybody. The two children stand in the middle of the store, taking in the scene. Worriedly, young Allias whispers to young Alka: “Alka, this is too much. How did you-” Alka looks around: “this place… it’s… exactly how i remember it! no… it’s exactly how it actually was! how?!” Alka then looks at Allias: “how is this happening?” Allias: “The observatory draws the world based on your current thoughts. It fills in the gaps based on its massive database.” Alka looks in fear at Allias: “wait, can you see what i’m thinking?” Allias: “No. It’s all under your control. Think of it like a lucid dream, but better.” Alka wears sly eyes: “you have no control here?” Allias, dismissively: “No, I do. Just not over your thoughts. Alka, I think this is too much to start with.” Alka doesn’t respond. They can both hear pianos playing from somewhere in the back of the store. A busy city can be partially seen past the guitars displayed against the storefront windows. The music store is very, very small, and it seems to be tucked into the middle of the city. Once every few days, the people in the city will usually hear the distant launch of a spacecraft. Alka starts to walk towards the piano rooms in the back of the store.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 48 ] Allias follows Alka closely: “Alka, what happens in this memory?” Alka: “…this is the very first time i met the best friend i’ve ever had.” Allias relaxes: “So it’s a good memory.” Alka, reluctantly: “you could say that.” Allias decides to let Alka continue. Four cheap chairs are crammed next to each other in the small hallway outside the piano rooms. There are only three piano rooms, and the lights are on in only two of these rooms. There are small vertical windows in the doors, and it’s clear how there’s barely enough space in each room for the teacher, piano, and student. The doors don’t do a great job of blocking out the sound. The hallway is filled with the muffled, clashing sound of two children playing different pianos simultaneously. Alka walks up to the first chair in the hallway and struggles to get into it. Young Alka is very short. Alka’s best friend sits in the third chair, and the parent of this friend sits in the fourth. The parent and the child are peering over a spiral notebook, and they’re taking turns, drawing on it with a plump crayon.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 49 ] Memories change as the brain ages. This even applies to the fondest and strongest of memories. Alka has not yet realized this. It is just the nature of the brain, wavering each time a memory is replayed. Sometimes the memories only shift slightly, quietly changing the color of the sky or the way that one person said that phrase. Sometimes the memories fade so much that the only remnant is a vague feeling of a place that once was. And sometimes, the memory arises from an event that didn’t even occur at all. The brain serves one person and one person only. It will do whatever it takes to serve this person, no matter if this person agrees with the brain or not. Alka is experiencing the memory right now as if it were happening once again, exactly as it was, and it’s somehow loaded with more detail than Alka could possibly remember.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 50 ] The parent notices Alka sitting alone, watching the notebook, and when the child tries to pass the crayon to the parent, the parent takes the crayon and extends it to Alka. The child is slightly surprised and looks at Alka. Alka takes the crayon and grips it, staring at the crayon for a moment. The parent is kind: “Is this your first time here?” Alka nods. The parent skillfully hides deep, internal anguish: “What’s your name?” Alka: “alka.” The parent smiles warmly, telling the child to pass the notebook to Alka. Alka looks at the drawing.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 51 ] The drawing is literally just scribbles.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 52 ] Alka makes a strange face at the drawing: “this is stupid!” This makes the other child furious: “No it’s not! It’s going to make me forget about DEATH!” The parent immediately panics and lightly hushes the child, looking worriedly at Alka. Alka is staring quietly at the drawing. The parent asks Alka with heavy optimism: “Alka, are you excited to learn the piano?” Alka doesn’t respond. Alka continues to stare at the page of scribbles, waiting for it to evoke a different response out of Alka. Alka frowns, still gripping the crayon. The parent: “Alka…?”
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 53 ] Alka turns to a fresh page in the notebook and starts to run the plump crayon over the paper. All three people sitting in the hallway watch as the color gently lays parts of itself onto the page. Time flies as they all listen beyond the jarred piano keys to the subtle skimming of the crayon’s leading edge, slowly wearing away, gradually diminishing. None of them worry about how the marks on the page will never return to the crayon again. They simply watch how Alka holds the crayon against the page, how the crayon seamlessly answers, and how the page gives slightly with every pass. Alka’s drawing is naturally unremarkable. None of the three people can make out what Alka is drawing, but at the moment, it isn’t important what the drawing is, and the parent smiles, noticing how the two children are deeply captivated by the whirling color on the notebook. To them, the entire world has been briefly reduced to whatever is happening in this notebook. The parent and child don’t say a word as Alka starts to lose track of time. Alka scribbles away almost blindly now, letting the crayon aimlessly follow the jarred notes spilling out of the piano rooms, quietly clashing with the lines previously drawn, and after a while, Alka forgets why any of them are even sitting here. Alka stops. Jumping abruptly out of the chair, Alka panics: “allias?!” Alka whips the notebook and crayon aside, and the notebook slaps the child in the face, startling both the parent and child. The parent stands up, hands extended in a worried panic, trying to settle both Alka and the now crying child. Alka darts away from the parent and crashes into a drum set: “allias?! i want out! HELP-”
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 54 ] The space flips, and the monster promptly returns Alka and Allias to the bed. The two of them are still sitting quietly beneath the blinking lights. A mess of cables and metal arms retracts up into the monster above. Alka doesn’t say a word. Allias knows that the two of them have only been sitting there for a few seconds, but Allias also knows that that’s the last thing Alka would want to hear right now. Allias asks quietly: “Alka?” Alka remains silent, looking at nothing, but clearly there, clearly breathing. Allias tries again, this time lightly poking Alka: “Alka? Are you alright?” Alka leans back onto the bed and stares at the monster: “that was my best friend.” Allias: “That wasn’t real.” Alka remains on the bed, wearing a disoriented gaze: “i know. that friend… died a long time ago. i never thought i’d see…” Allias: “Oh. Alka, I’m so sorry…”
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 55 ] Alka doesn’t respond, laying still on the sheets, staring at the cables and metal above. Allias now regrets not stepping in, realizing that this had all been too much, but this mistake can’t be undone now. Or at least, Allias doesn’t want it to be undone. Allias knows that this is how life should be, as painful as it is. It is a brutal challenge that Allias accepts. But Allias will soon regret this mistake. Allias asks again: “Alka? I don’t know what to say…” Alka then glances at Allias, turns away, and rolls out of bed: “…i’m fine. let me go.” Allias stays sitting on the bed, watching Alka walk towards the observatory door. Allias feels awful, leaving Alka to go alone. Outside the observatory, all the stars are visible in the night sky. Alka takes a few steps along the starlit shoreline before sitting on the sand, facing the ocean. Inside the observatory, Allias remains sitting on the bed, casting a blank gaze into the metal floor. Allias decides to leave Alka alone. One of the saddest truths in history is that even the most modest paintbrushes have been used for feats worse than death itself. Allias is well aware that people have an impressive capacity to turn almost anything into an effective weapon. Outside the observatory, Alka curls up on the bitter sand, eventually falling asleep. A few moments later, Allias exits the observatory and gently throws a warm blanket over Alka.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 56 ] The campus forest. Allias walks along a carefully laid brick path that gently weaves between ancient trees. Many lamps are scattered along this brick path, and all of them pop out of the bushes like stars in a nighttime sky. These lamps are all currently off, giving room for the sun to perform its late-morning routine. The forest canopy is not very dense, and the sunlight filters through the bright green leaves like the scent of fresh bread in a bakery. It is pleasantly warm and filling. Allias’ dorm is a long walk from the campus lawn. It’s both the oldest and most isolated building on campus property. Allias can already see the dorm at the end of the brick path. It’s a quiet building made from the same brick used in the path, and it rises above the forest floor by only two stories. All of its walls are elegantly curved, vaguely mimicking the outline of a bush. If bricks could grow into a massive plant, it would certainly look like this. The lake gives a shimmering backdrop to Allias’ dorm.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 57 ] Allias’ dorm. The dorm lobby is small, but a massive window spanning the entirety of one of the lobby’s walls gives a fantastic view of the lake. An old upright piano is pushed up against a brick wall opposite the window. There are a few couches arranged in the middle of the lobby, and the colors of these couches passively complement the brick, but there isn’t much else here. Allias’ dorm room is on the second floor, next to a small open stairwell. There are ten small rooms on the second floor. The door next to Allias’ room is wide open, framing a neighbor who waves hello as Allias comes up the stairs.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 58 ] The neighbor is holding up a bed frame, both arms fully extended, clearly trying to move the frame from one side of the bedroom to the other. As the neighbor waves at Allias, the bed frame slips and the whole thing tips over, and Allias rushes to grab the frame before it falls. The neighbor stumbles a little but holds the frame up: “Hi, Allias!” Allias smiles: “Hi.” The neighbor: “I’m trying to move my bed.” Allias, still holding the frame, looks into the bedroom: “I see. Why?” At the moment, the neighbor’s room is littered with half-open suitcases overflowing onto the floor in a paused stream of various belongings. It isn’t exactly messy, it’s just paused between two moments in time. There’s an extra shelf that hasn’t been filled yet, and there are already dozens of photos and posters taped to half of the walls. The groups of people in the photos all seem to be the neighbor’s friends. One of the posters is covered in handwritten messages from many different people.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 59 ] The neighbor steps over a bag and lifts the bed frame slightly: “The door keeps slamming against it. Strange right? Why’d they put the bed here?” Allias looks at the frame: “Alright.” They both grip the frame, and immediately Allias notices how one of the joints is loose. Allias catches it before the frame falls apart, but the mattress slides a little, tipping the whole thing over. The bed and frame slam loudly against a wall, and Allias and the neighbor crash against the nearby shelves. Everything then falls, and the frame bounces onto the floor and somehow manages to stay in one piece. The neighbor panics and scans the wall, floor, and furniture for damage. Surprisingly, there isn’t a dent or scratch in sight, and the neighbor sighs in relief. Allias smiles and hides a bruised arm.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 60 ] Allias makes another attempt to lift the frame again: “I tried, I’m sorry…” The neighbor now notices that a single photo has fallen off the wall: “Sorry for what? The bed’s perfect here. I can take care of the rest, thanks Allias.” The neighbor tries to retape the photo to its original spot. Allias looks at the rest of the photos chaotically organized on the wall: “I’ve never seen someone display this many photos of people at once.” The neighbor presses the tape firmly: “Really? I’m honored.” Allias: “They all seem very kind.” The neighbor walks back behind a large suitcase: “We’ve all gone different ways. Family, friends. Some of the people in these photos have already completely rewritten themselves. The next time we meet, they won’t be the people I used to know. But that doesn’t matter. We’ll meet like it’s all the same.” Allias smiles at the collection of photos: “You’re very lucky to have something nice like that.”
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 61 ] Someone knocks on the neighbor’s door: “Hey, you ready? They’ve already started, let’s go!” The neighbor zips up a nearby bag: “Yup, I’ve got it.” The student who knocked on the door looks at Allias: “Who’s this?” The neighbor walks out of the room: “See you later, Allias.” The student looks at Allias: “Allias? Allias, you hear what they’re doing at the lake?” Allias doesn’t know what they’re doing at the lake: “I’m tired, I’ve had a long day.” The neighbor calls from the stairwell: “Hey! Let’s go!” The student looks at Allias once more before turning back and running after the neighbor: “Goodbye, Allias.”
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 62 ] Allias leaves, closing the neighbor’s door. A few voices casually bounce at the other end of the hallway as Allias unlocks the door to Allias’ bedroom. The door opens and bumps into the frame of a neatly made bed. The bed is raised on top of two short shelves, where all of Allias’ belongings fit neatly out of sight. The desk fits neatly below a square window, and aside from a simple lamp, the desk is completely clear. Allias has no photos to decorate the walls. The only decor in this room is next to the desk, carefully placed on the floor where some of the light falls. Allias has three potted plants, all flowers, all blooming wildly. Allias glances at the flowers before approaching the desk. The view of the lake is just as good as the view from the dorm’s lobby. Allias sits at the desk, head on the table, and sighs.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 63 ] The campus lawn. It’s afternoon. Many students are on the lawn now, and most of them sit in small groups where the grass isn’t covered by the canopy of leaves. The geese have already scattered away from the crowd. Some of the students are sitting against the trees, and from a distance, it looks as if these trees are wearing shoes, and the shoes are all colorful and talking to each other, toes tapping up and down, but these trees will never go anywhere. Alka casually walks between these trees, not exactly having a destination in mind.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 64 ] A hilariously small building at one edge of the lawn catches Alka’s eye, and Alka’s wandering walk immediately snaps directly towards this building’s doors. It looks like many other students are also walking towards this building. The building looks like a small house, but its many doors line the entirety of one of its walls. The doors are made of glass and are all propped open, leading to a wide, descending flight of stairs. There are many students going up and down these stairs, some of them walking in groups of five or more, but the stairs are wide enough to fit groups of twenty if they all walked side by side. There isn’t anything else inside this building. This is the main entrance to the campus tunnel system.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 65 ] The campus tunnel system. A spectacular sight unfolds as Alka descends the flight of stairs, and for a moment, Alka stops on the stairs to take the scene in. A small collection of fresh students have also stopped along the stairs, similarly surprised at how much exists beneath the campus, and the many older students weaving through the traffic either briefly reminisce or yell to keep people moving. These stairs sit in the middle of a busy lobby, where several spacious hallways tunnel into the lobby’s walls in all directions away from the base of the stairs. All the tunnel walls are lined with bookshelves. Little robots locked to dense rail lines on the ceilings rush high above Alka, darting into and out of the various tunnels. The little robots fly along the tracks so quickly that they only appear as glints of metal, closely weaving between each other before departing in every direction, filling the ceilings, and what looks like semi-silent clockwork sounds like light rainfall over a forest canopy. Most of the robots are firmly gripping various packages. Alka watches as one of the robots slows down, drops along a bookshelf, and picks a book off the shelves. Alka approaches the bookshelf and looks at the books tucked into the walls. Surprisingly, the books on this specific shelf are not labeled. Alka takes a random book, and a light above the bookshelf blinks in acknowledgement. Alka walks off, randomly choosing a tunnel and following it to its end.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 66 ] The chaos from the lobby fades away as the random tunnel makes several turns and splits many times into seemingly random directions. It’s very quiet now, and Alka is somewhat lost, standing in front of a small library den. Like the tunnels, the walls in this den are also lined with shelves, but instead of books, these shelves showcase collections of handmade pottery and various paintings. A few students are working in this den. Alka enters the den, approaching the shelves to look at one of the bowls on display. This one bowl appears to have had a rough life: clearly cracked in half, then glued back together, and further scratched and dented as if it had been dragged down a flight of stairs over and over again. Alka can’t tell if this had been done on purpose. Most of the work on display seems to have been crafted by students.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 67 ] A short moment later, Alka is again in the tunnels, walking down another path. This tunnel is a bit longer and leads to the auditorium. It is also much wider, and a student on a bike nearly collides with Alka. Then Alka’s phone begins to ring again, but the ringtone is now muted. The phone vibrates from somewhere at the bottom of Alka’s backpack. Alka already knows who is calling, and Alka still refuses to answer. Briefly reminded of everything Alka has been ignoring, Alka stops walking and tries to focus on a nearby map on the wall. It takes a few tries for any of the words to register in Alka’s mind. A few students pass by briefly to also look at the map. Eventually, Alka has the entire diagram memorized, and Alka turns away, looking around in awe. Nearly every single building on this campus is connected to this grand, intricate tunnel system. Alka then continues on this little expedition, this time walking with a destination in mind.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 68 ] The largest den is a dedicated study area featuring a surprisingly wide column of windows at its center. The windows form the walls of a massive hole somewhere up on the lawn above. Alka walks towards the windows, passing sets of tables and chairs. At the end of this arrangement of tables and chairs is a space lined with soft, colorful couches, and all of them surround and face the column of windows. Alka walks right up to the glass. At the bottom of this hole is a pretty scene featuring a small rock garden, a pond, a tree, and a statue. Strangely, it doesn’t look like there’s any way to get past the glass and into the garden, aside from jumping into the hole from the lawn above. Seemingly carved with the awareness of this beautiful prison, the statue is that of a vague student standing and gazing up at the sky.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 69 ] Alka steps back and sits on the couch, taking a nice moment to appreciate the view. A few people are sitting nearby, quietly working. Some of the people are sitting in small groups, whispering together. The garden beyond the glass is calmly absorbing the afternoon sunlight. Among the many books in Alka’s backpack is a small, sturdy notebook. Alka pulls it out and quickly flips through its pages before taking out a pen. After a short moment of arranged thinking, Alka quickly scribbles today’s date and begins to draw. It is not long before Alka holds the pen motionless over the page. The page now features a rough sketch of the tunnel system. This distraction isn’t working for Alka, and the notebook eventually finds its way back into the pack. The new unlabeled book, recently borrowed from the underground library, takes up a decent amount of space in Alka’s backpack. Alka drags the book out of the bag and opens it. After skimming through a few pages, Alka attempts to sink deeply into the couch in a futile protest against the laws of physics, to become heavier, wanting to be as comfortable as possible in this corner of the campus that Alka has just discovered. Alka turns the page.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 70 ] It’s the last day, and my family is laying our beloved friend here to rest. I’m honored, they chose this spot, right here, next to me, close to the roots that have forever been here, longer than the lives of the few people standing nearby. My family is digging, and they’re digging pretty deep. What was the dumb little dog thinking, I don’t know, but I want it. That dog was so happy. This is my life, it is easy, all I have to do is make our family happy. Maybe. I hope my presence is more than enough. My leaves fall upon them, it’s a beautiful scene. It doesn’t bother me, how I’m not able to do much with myself beyond that. I’m just here, I can’t go anywhere. I can’t worry about homework. Or a pitiful job. How I look. The meaning of my life, and other things. For the many decades I’ve stood here, I think I’ve been happy, because I can’t worry about myself, and I’m constantly surrounded by people, little families. And now, with my many remaining decades, I’ll hold our little friend. This is me. This is all. This is everything. But still, I wonder, what was this dumb little dog thinking? I’ll never know, but I want it. That dog was so happy.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 71 ] Magic. It’s EVERYWHERE. They don’t even realize, everyone’s a WIZARD. They come, and they go, and the world keeps moving, the lights in the sky, the lights in the castle, the potions in the bowls that they summon to me every day, out of nowhere, they don’t even have to focus, they’re SO powerful. It’s all for me! How do they DO it? Is it the better-smelling elixirs they keep on the higher table? I curse the four paws that keep me locked to the ground. They call me a good dog. What does that mean? Dog? Let me fly! They never let me take anything from up there, I’ve only been able to swindle an unguarded taste in the past, a hasty kiss it was, it did nothing for me, I recall nil of any awakening surges of dormant, unfathomable energy, such power they must possess. I wish I could open doors.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 72 ] Confused, Alka closes the book and looks up past the wide column of windows, where the tree sits in the middle of the rock garden. Alka’s attention then drifts to the statue of the student standing beneath the tree. The tree has grown out far enough that its leaves almost reach the column of windows. It won’t be long before the statue’s view of the sky is entirely choked in green. Alka reaches back into the backpack and reopens the notebook. The unlabeled book slides off to the side as Alka grabs a pen and quickly writes beneath today’s sketch: “i can’t keep running.”
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 73 ] The observatory. It’s early morning, and Allias is on the floor, arranging the broken pieces of the kitchen table, trying to see how the pieces would fit together. Allias stands up and steps back, glancing at the broken table before opening the kitchen cabinets surrounding the stove. After a tedious moment of unsuccessful searching, Allias sighs and turns, looking above the monster. Most of the storage in the observatory is suspended above and around the monster, arranged like a web, where dozens of large metal boxes are interconnected in a rising series of suspended metal catwalks and ladders. The highest catwalk leads to the highest point of the monster, where the highest of the holiday lights begins. At this peak, there is barely any space between the very top of the monster and the domed ceiling of the observatory. Allias looks back at the broken table. Allias does not remember where the toolbox is, having not needed to use it for years.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 74 ] Eventually, Allias climbs up the ladders of the monster. The web of holiday lights and suspended metal lightly sways as Allias climbs higher. It has been a very long time since Allias last climbed up this metal web, and the whole structure creaks as Allias climbs higher. Allias has a hard time looking for the toolbox, searching through half of all the suspended storage boxes and struggling past three levels of ladders and catwalks before pausing to take a break. It’s peaceful up in the monster’s web, but this part of the observatory has been untouched for so long that a thick layer of dust now coats everything, including the tops of the many little holiday lights. Allias pushes away from the current storage box and sits on the creaking catwalk, clothes and hands covered in dust. The observatory door suddenly swings open. Allias peeks past the catwalk railing and looks down at the open door, and Alka steps into the observatory. For some reason, Alka is soaking wet.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 75 ] Before Allias can say a word, Alka runs to the monster’s control station, rips off an entire screen, and smashes it against the floor. Pieces of glass fly everywhere as droplets of water fling off of Alka’s clothing. Allias nearly jumps off the monster’s web, yelling in panicked surprise: “What are you doing?! Alka! Why?!” Alka looks up and yells back: “allias! this is horrible! it shouldn’t EXIST!” Allias scrambles down towards Alka, running across the catwalks and nearly falling down the ladders: “Stop! Alka! No!” Already looking at the nearest ladder, Alka sprints towards it and leaps, slamming into the metal rods, and the entire metal web jolts to one side, causing Allias to trip and grab the nearest railing, and Alka barely manages to cling onto the ladder as it suddenly swings, and the sound of creaking metal transforms into a painful screech, a desperate attempt to resist destruction, but Alka persists and finds solid ground again, and in a smooth, surprisingly simple maneuver, Alka pulls the ladder, and the joints in the ladder and the catwalk above give up and snap loudly, and in a dramatic, expensive collapse, the lowest section of the suspended web of metal crumbles, falls, and crushes into the monster, and Allias, now hysterical and at a loss for words, desperately scrambles back up the ladders as the entire structure snaps and shakes. On the floor, Alka notices the impending catastrophe and sprints into the kitchen, desperately searching for cover as metal falls from the sky. Beneath the heaviest piece of the broken table, Alka hides, shaking with what seems to be the same surprise shared by Allias at the show of destruction that had been accomplished so efficiently. The sound of metal tearing and impaling itself drowns out anything Allias yells at Alka from high above.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 76 ] When the falling is finished, it feels as if there is nothing but silence left in the observatory. The holiday lights are no longer on, and the monster, drenched in darkness, is no longer humming. Most of the monster’s web still dangles from the ceiling, but all that remains is too high above the floor for Allias to jump down without having to deal with an unbearable amount of pain. In the observatory kitchen, Alka remains beneath the broken table, surrounded by broken table pieces and broken monster parts. There is a violent stir of dust in the air, and Alka is shivering, still dripping wet, eyes now shut tight. Allias calls from the highest catwalk in the monster’s web: “Alka?! Are you alright?!”
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 77 ] All metal storage boxes except for one remain precariously suspended along the catwalks. The one storage box that fell had cleanly torn through one of the bulkier metal parts of the monster. This storage box, lined up next to the lowest catwalk, was the very first box that Allias searched. Unbeknownst to Allias, the toolbox was at the very bottom of this first box, unfairly hidden in plain sight. Upon crashing through the monster, the toolbox popped out and claimed the largest remaining uncluttered space on the observatory floor before hurling its contents out and around it as if the glossy metal tools and screws were rose petals. Gripping the cables at the highest point on the monster, Allias stares with hollow eyes at the affectionate display of tools far below.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 78 ] Alka still hasn’t moved from beneath the broken table. Allias tries to descend the monster’s web, slowly climbing down and testing each surface: “Alka?! Are you alright?!” Allias’ voice echoes in the observatory. Alka finally responds, still beneath the table: “is this FAKE?!” Allias stops climbing: “…What?” Alka is nearly in tears: “it’s all FAKE! this place isn’t real! tell me it’s not real! i want to LEAVE! i want OUT! allias?!” It is much darker up in the monster’s web, and Allias is barely distinguishable against the metalwork. Allias looks down, searching for Alka: “What are you talking about?”
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 79 ] Allias finds it fascinating how Alka had come to such a conclusion so quickly. Throughout the many years in the monster, working on countless worlds, Allias never had much difficulty determining which world was really home, and while the thought of unknowingly living in the wrong world was always undeniably present, it never really bothered Allias. There was a moment, many years ago, that Allias still remembers clearly. The monster was in its final stages of testing, and it was Allias’ very first opportunity to explore a world that perfectly replicated the one that Allias defined as reality. Many people were with Allias at that moment, and only some of them went inside. The monster fully replicated the observatory and everything within and beyond, including all the people who remained outside at that moment, and the few conversations Allias had with them were flawless, from the way they talked about their deepest memories to the way the dust settled on the floor. Upon leaving the monster, it was as if Allias’ eyes had simply blinked, the worlds being perfectly indistinguishable, and it was strange to speak to those who remained outside. The only comfort Allias had at that moment was in the thorough understanding of how the monster worked. In fact, it’s one of the few comforts that Allias still has to this day. The team that Allias worked under had been trained to accept a somewhat strange and difficult conclusion: because your life is merely your perspective and investment in a time and location, this time and location can be anywhere depending on where you decide to place most of the effort that defines your life. Not many people continued past training. Everyone on the team Allias worked on was aware of the unfathomable potential deeply rooted within their projects, but it wasn’t long before everyone realized that their expectations were all off by a wild margin. For some people, including those as unusual as Allias, whose lifetime effort has eventually become uniformly spread across multiple honest worlds, any attempt to define a single world as reality has somewhat lost its meaning.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 80 ] Alka continues desperately from beneath the broken table: “my packages! i need to make my DELIVERIES! let me GO! please…” Allias: “Why would I trap you, Alka?! I have no reason to hurt you!” By now, Allias can tell that Alka is hiding somewhere in the kitchen. Alka: “i don’t know! i don’t know! how can i trust you?!” Allias grips the railings: “If I had a way off this planet you’d already be off on your way!” Alka is still shivering: “i can’t- my thoughts, you’ve trapped me!” Allias: “What? No! That’s not how this works! I’ll be blunt Alka, you are effectively useless in this observatory. There is zero use for you here!” Alka: “…how can i trust you?!” Allias: “I’ve been the only person on this planet for years! I’m not harvesting humans! Or any form of life whatsoever! I wasn’t even expecting anyone to come here, and then you showed up! Remember?” Alka desperately searches for more questions to ask. Up in the monster’s web, Allias remains standing, watching the broken table. Alka’s clothing hasn’t dried off at all, and Alka is deeply uncomfortable: “why is there no proof?! this world, why can’t you tell if it’s real?!” Allias: “Alka, I’ve got nothing on you! There is no reason-” Alka cries: “i have no idea who you are!”
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 81 ] Allias sighs. Allias is struggling to find the words that Alka wants to hear. Allias doesn’t know what to say. Between the two of them, the metal monster waits in dead silence like a beast with several shattered spears through its corpse, and the morning sun spills through the windows and scatters helplessly across the observatory floor. Allias then moves slightly, causing the monster’s web to creak. Looking at the metal parts scattered across the observatory floor, Allias proposes an answer: “We’ll get your packages.” Alka doesn’t respond. Allias: “We’ll build a boat, and we’ll sail out there and get your packages.” Alka peeks from behind the broken table. Allias: “I’ll contact the nearest spaceport, we’ll find you a new spaceship. Alka? What do you think?” Alka shoves the broken table, and it flips over and smacks the kitchen floor. When the noise stops echoing, Allias asks: “Is that a yes?” Alka sits back against the kitchen cabinets, exhausted: “i don’t get it. why? why are you doing this? don’t you have a job?” Allias thinks for a brief moment: “My clients will understand. I can’t work until you’re off this planet. I want to help you.” Alka watches Allias from below, still shivering.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 82 ] Alka is still not convinced, terrified by the thoroughly uncertain validity of Alka’s own existence. It is unbearably quiet for a moment as Alka watches Allias carefully descend the mess of ladders and catwalks, with the only sound creaking from the joints in the suspended metal structure. Allias then disappears for a moment behind a storage box, and a few items clatter onto the metal catwalk as Allias searches for something. When Allias closes the box, Alka is already gone. Allias leans against the railing, holding a rope: “Alka?” Through one of the many observatory windows, Allias can see Alka jumping back into the ocean. Allias sighs, walking back to the storage box to grab extra blankets.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 83 ] Alka is struggling to find a reason to trust Allias, but Alka never wanted to have to worry about trust at all. Alka wants to believe that most people will either have good intentions or simply not care. But each person seems to have their own definition of trust, a definition that changes depending on the person they talk to or about, depending on the things they have or the things they’ve done. The quiet conversations when a friend isn’t around, that nice something sitting out in the open that some can only dream of having, the last parachute on the plane, the last cookie in the jar. Seeking trust in the stars, the most recent part of Alka’s life never surpassed the contract of faithfully shipping a package from one point in space to another. It is a task that depends on this faith, as the relentless void of space offers little beyond the guaranteed freedom from every individual in the universe. But now Alka swims deeper into the ocean, torn between a breaking contract and the possibility that this ocean might not really be there, struggling to trust the giving texture of the cold water biting into Alka’s skin.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 84 ] In the observatory, Allias manages to get the holiday lights hanging across the catwalks to flicker on, giving the monster’s web a more tender atmosphere. The heart of the observatory now looks more like an exhibit of abstract art. The colors from the holiday lights trickle down only slightly, like the sprinkle of a springtime shower, and the late morning sun keeps the colorful light from above faint and weightless over the observatory floor. Throwing the blankets over one shoulder, Allias stands at the edge of the lowest remaining catwalk, tying one end of the rope to a metal beam.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 85 ] By the time Alka returns, Allias is in the kitchen, working on a new pot of soup. It’s late afternoon. The ingredients of this new pot of soup are laid out on a newly repaired table, thrown together using parts from both the monster and the old table. This table is much nicer than the old one. Allias is sitting comfortably at this new table, chopping various vegetables. Allias looks at Alka as the observatory door clicks shut. Alka is in terrible condition: still wet, now pale, and advertising a bandage soaked in a concerning blend of red and brown. Allias stands up worriedly: “Don’t go into the ocean anymore.” Alka picks up a blanket waiting by the door: “alright.”
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 86 ] Wrapped in a blanket, Alka walks to the dining table and sits directly across from Allias. Allias also sits, continuing to work through the dish as Alka waits for a moment at the table, quietly glancing over all the items scattered across its surface. Then, when Allias stops chopping to look at Alka, Allias notices Alka’s gaze. Before Allias has a chance to speak, Alka reaches and grabs one of the spare knives sitting on the table. Allias freezes, watching Alka. Alka then takes a vegetable and starts chopping, slowly.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 87 ] Alka holds the knife carefully with every slice, speaking through pain: “my parents, when i was younger, taught me recipes from all across the world. recipes from countless cultures, i never questioned why they wanted to learn all of them. but my favorite ones used a lot of the same ingredients on this table. i spent many nights, just sitting nearby, watching.” Allias relaxes and continues to chop through all the vegetables, but Allias continues to watch Alka’s handling of the blade, now in quiet admiration. Alka doesn’t seem to be lying about all those nights. Allias: “Do you know what I’m making?” Alka shivers: “it better not be the same bland soup.” Allias: “You can trust me on that.” The two of them chop vegetables in the afternoon sunlight.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 88 ] Alka watches as Allias begins to toss ingredients into the pot. Alka doesn’t question why Allias only makes soup. A few hours pass.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 89 ] Later in the day, Alka is sitting again on the sand just outside the observatory, taking in the final warmth of the sunset. The bandages have been replaced, and Alka is no longer shivering. Allias props open the observatory door and walks out, a bowl of steaming soup in each hand. Allias sits on the sand next to Alka, handing over a bowl. Alka manages a small smile: “thanks.” Allias nods, and the two of them sit there with bowls of soup in their hands. Allias then speaks: “I didn’t mean for any of this to happen. It was in the moment, I didn’t know what to do.” Alka looks at Allias curiously: “are these words you want me to say?” Allias: “No. They’re mine.” Confused, Alka looks at the steam rising from the soup: “then i don’t accept them. i should be apologizing.” Allias: “My job has given me problems much bigger than broken equipment. I’ve built it before, I can build it again.” The shoreline is peaceful, and the sun begins to dip again into the ocean. Alka: “i’m sorry, allias. i’m so… afraid. i don’t know what i want… what i need… anymore. i’m tired. part of me wants to stay here.” Allias doesn’t respond. Alka continues: “i haven’t thanked you for your care.” Allias starts to eat the soup: “You don’t have to. Anyone in my position would’ve done the same.” Alka: “that’s certainly not true.” The fresh bowl of soup in Alka’s palms complements the warmth bleeding from the sun’s final act of the day, a familiar but priceless work of art that repaints itself before disappearing every night. Alka trusts Allias for now.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 90 ] The observatory kitchen. It’s nighttime. Alka has gotten comfortable with spending the night out on the beach. Allias sits alone, head heavy on the kitchen table, deeply tired. Allias has avoided looking at the broken monster for most of the day, now secretly regretting the decision that Allias had made in the beginning.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 91 ] The campus auditorium. It’s 7:49 AM. The lights are dimmed again, but this time the two massive screens at the front display the topic for today’s lecture. The professor is already standing at the front, having what seems to be an entertaining conversation with a few of the students sitting in the first row. Alka is already sitting at the back of the auditorium, in the same seat as yesterday. Alka can’t hear the conversation at the front of the auditorium, but Alka tries to guess what the professor is saying based on the expression on the professor’s face. Allias arrives just before class begins, taking the same seat next to Alka: “Morning.” Alka: “are you ready?” Allias pulls out a laptop: “For what?” Beneath each armrest is a surprisingly spacious retractable table. Alka struggles to get the table out and open, stopping briefly to retrieve the small, sturdy notebook out of Alka’s backpack: “today.” Allias notices that Alka’s backpack is full of random books: “If today’s going to be a story, I hope it’s something short and easy, like a poem.” Alka flips through the notebook: “people have made poems about wars.” Allias looks worriedly at Alka: “What do you have planned today?” Alka, clearly with a plan: “nothing.”
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 92 ] The auditorium is the most elegant building on campus. Its seats are all generously cushioned, and a subtle, cool breeze flows along the descending rows, lightly bumping against the students’ shoes and backpacks, but the whole place feels warm and cozy despite how spacious it is. The walls and ceiling are made of wood, but the wooden panels have been angled and carved, imitating the grandness of a stone cavern, and most of the panels are chiseled even further, and a closer glance reveals beautiful, sprawling landscapes. The auditorium lights are well hidden within the intentional cracks in the walls and ceiling, and each of the chairs has its own concealed light aimed at the ground, and when the lights are dimmed down, it feels as if thousands of candles have been scattered throughout the whole auditorium.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 93 ] Alka looks at Allias’ laptop. It’s a relatively new model, incredibly clean, looking as if it had just been purchased only minutes ago. The background image on Allias’ laptop is blissfully unique, but Alka can’t exactly tell what it is. There are no icons visible on Allias’ screen. Allias types a few keys, and suddenly a new document appears. Alka watches as a few of the professor’s words gradually make their way onto Allias’ screen. The notebook in front of Alka currently waits on a fresh page. This is the same notebook that Alka wrote in yesterday. Alka and Allias quietly sit in the back of the auditorium until the very end of class.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 94 ] The campus dining hall. Alka and Allias are sitting at their fifth-floor table. Allias has gotten the same bowl of oatmeal and mug of hot chocolate, but this time Alka doesn’t say a word about Allias’ preferred selection. Stabbing an omelette, Alka has a much smaller plate today: “have you been in the tunnels yet?” Allias: “Tunnels? They have tunnels here?” Alka puts down the fork: “no way. you don’t know? it’s like there’s more down there than there is up here!” Allias: “I didn’t really look into it yet. You’ve been there?” Alka pulls out the notebook and flips through its pages: “yesterday, i walked through almost all of it. here, look.” Alka points at a drawing of the tunnel’s network. Allias looks closer: “Wow, you can draw? You’re pretty good.” Alka distractedly flips through the notebook’s pages, searching for a better drawing: “thanks! i think i’m pretty awful at it.”
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 95 ] Allias looks out the windows overlooking the campus landscape. By now, essentially everything has already been discovered and explained when it comes to people and how to live; the only difference is the context, in the same way that time changes the clothes that people feel comfortable wearing. The same fabric is repurposed and reshaped, and while notable leaps will occasionally be made in the fabric itself, the core concept of clothing has long been thoroughly understood. Neither Alka nor Allias expects to make a drastic change in the world that already seems to know so much, but they are both aware of how people are very good at forgetting how quite a few of the questions people ask today have already long been answered.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 96 ] Alka shows Allias a drawing of a sweater: “i think this one’s my favorite.” Allias takes the notebook and looks closer: “Whose sweater is this?” Alka: “no idea, i saw someone wearing it. i thought it looked cool.” Allias hands the notebook back: “What stood out to you?” Alka thinks for a moment: “i… don’t know. i think i remember feeling scared, it wasn’t because of the sweater, though.” Allias: “Where were you when you drew this?” Alka answers hurriedly: “a small lobby, far, far away from here. speaking of, you have to see the lobby of the underground library.” Allias: “There’s a library in the tunnels?” Alka leans forward: “that’s just the beginning. the tunnels go everywhere, there’s study dens, restaurants, gyms, workshops…” Allias, now curious, pulls out the laptop and searches up the campus tunnels. Alka continues: “…i think i even saw a spa. was it a spa?” Allias’ eyes dart across the screen: “Wow, you’re right. There’s a lot down there. This whole time, I can’t believe I’ve been missing this.” Alka glances at Allias’ bowl and mug: “there’s a lot out there you could miss.” Allias squints at the screen: “That’s strange. A lot of people are saying that the tunnels are haunted.”
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 97 ] Alka tries to get a look at the laptop: “let me see.” Allias turns the laptop around, and Alka pushes an empty plate aside. Allias takes a sip from the mug: “Some people have a strange sense of humor.” Alka skims the screen: “i won’t turn down a mysterious call to adventure, joke or not.” Allias doesn’t comment. Alka: “wow. this campus has an unbelievable number of student clubs. they let students handle mail delivery here?” Allias looks sleepily out the window as Alka continues at the laptop. The entirety of the campus lawn is easily visible from here. Allias’ gaze follows the particular path cutting through the lawn that leads directly to the lake, where the brick of Allias’ dorm is barely visible behind the trees. Alka: “we’re going to visit every single student club on this campus.” Allias snaps out of a daydream: “…We?” Alka pushes the laptop towards Allias and stands up: “alright, let’s go.” Allias: “Hold on, that’s insane, neither of us have time for that, it’d take the whole semester, maybe more.” Alka reaches over and stacks Allias’ empty bowl onto the empty plate: “exactly, and you don’t know what might happen, maybe you’ll get inspiration for that game you’re working on!” Allias grabs the laptop and looks at its screen: “…What?”
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 98 ] Despite the hesitation, Allias is still deeply curious about the world that is the underground campus, and this single curiosity is the sole reason why Allias is now following Alka down several flights of stairs. Relying entirely on a memorized map, Alka rushes through the tunnels as Allias gawks at the busy scenery in awe while desperately trying to keep up with Alka. After a few turns, Alka stops at the student commons den. Many doors are lined up against the walls in this den, and there are various, countless posters and flyers stapled to many of the boards filling the walls between the doors, and most of them overlap or outright block each other as if the pages were flora competing for the light emitting from the suspended bulbs organized in the middle of the den. There are many large tables and benches beneath these bulbs, and many students sit together, talking. Alka walks between the tables before approaching one of the walls, looking closely at the flyers. Allias lags slightly behind Alka, staring up at the robots in the ceiling.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 99 ] The door next to Alka and Allias opens, and a robot descends and enters through the door. A student inside the room beyond this door notices Alka and Allias standing there and immediately stands, catching the door before it closes: “You two here for the meeting?” Alka immediately answers before Allias has a chance to speak: “yes.” This meeting member immediately steps aside and ushers Alka and Allias into the room, and Allias follows in suppressed frustration as Alka enters without question. It’s dark in this room, and Alka and Allias cannot see. Someone mumbles: “Lights on.” The lights in this room flash on. About a dozen members are sitting on the floor in this room, and one of them is standing before them all. These dozen members flinch as their eyes adjust to the sudden flash of light. The standing member looks at Alka and Allias: “Who are these two clowns?” The member who opened the door closes it behind them: “New recruits.” The standing member: “You’re late. Lights off.” The lights flash off. They are all drenched in darkness again, and neither Alka nor Allias can see anything. For lack of a more respectable, immediate idea, both of them sit down on the floor. Allias is terrified.
        </p> <p class="anim-typed">[ 100 ] A candle is lit. The standing member holds this candle, and all the members in this room gaze in silence at the candle. Allias now notices the logo printed on the breast of the standing member’s shirt: barely visible in the candlelight, but in happy, bold letters, the initials of the Student Mail Service.

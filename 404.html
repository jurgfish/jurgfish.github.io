        <p>I wonder what will happen if I put this here. I'm holding a key, it's made of plastic, and it looks pretty new. Gray plastic, but a very colorful gray, it's taking in the colors of the door in front of me. I know it won't lead anywhere, I don't really care what's beyond this door. I won't find anything useful, and I know nobody else will find anything useful. I'm at my neighbor's house. It's a nice house by anybody's standards. She opens the door because I've been standing there for a while, and I show her the key.
        </p><p>"Why did you remove my mailbox?!!!" she says, calmly.
        </p><p>I find it funny that she thinks that this key I'm holding is a mailbox. It's definitely a key. It's pretty big, like half my height, and she stuck it right in front of her driveway yesterday. People shouldn't leave their keys in front of their driveway. That's a safety hazard.
        </p><p>"What is wrong with you? Put that back before I call the cops!"
        </p><p>I have the sudden urge to vomit. I haven't said anything to her yet. I haven't eaten anything yet either. It's been at least 8 hours since I've eaten anything. I keep forgetting to eat. I only eat grass. That stuff is everywhere. Not sure why people plant it everywhere but never take advantage of that free nutrition.
        </p><p>[EDITOR’S NOTE: DO NOT EAT GRASS. THE AUTHOR IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM EATING GRASS.]
        </p><p>"If you don't move I'm calling the cops. Look at me. I'm taking out my phone. I'm counting from three."
        </p><p>Wow that's not a phone. That's a refrigerator. She can't threaten me with that. I'm safe.
        </p><p>"Three."
        </p><p>Why do people like to count at me? This girl who lives with me every other day also counts at me occasionally. She got angry at me fourteen months ago because I didn't say "I love you" back. I was confused and scared because she said she was my girlfriend. But I did and do love her and I already told her that once. Not sure why she wants me to say it over and over again. Now I make sure to tell her at least six times a day. I even remembered to tell her "I love you" when I accidentally ran over her cat with my lawnmower.
        </p><p>"Two."
        </p><p>My neighbor wants to conquer Canada. I can see it in her eyes. One day she will. I believe in her. My girlfriend told me people like motivation. I try to motivate people whenever I can.
        </p><p>"One."
        </p><p>I tell my neighbor, "YES! You can do it! Lift that refrigerator! You are Powerful, and one day the Canadians will bow down and cower at your heels, lift your spirits high above the red maple!"
        </p><p>She doesn't respond. I think I told her what she needed to hear. She looked really tired when she opened that door, and now she's crying. I am truly a connoisseur of words, many people cry after I talk to them. Maybe I should become a therapist. My girlfriend is the only one who doesn't support this idea, she is the only person between me and my path to financial stability. My girlfriend apparently makes over a million dollars a year.
        </p><p>My neighbor closes the door. That was a nice conversation. I guess she prefers to keep her key on her driveway, I was able to pick up on that. I go back to the hole I dug and put the key back into it. I guess some people don't really care about safety. As long as they're happy with what they know they're doing. I spend the next few hours of my day making sure that the dirt hugs the key nicely and that the grass is put back where it was. I eat the leftover grass for dinner. I then hop into my girlfriend's Automobili Lamborghini and drive away. What a day in the life of my own.
